        "content": "It’s up to real estate agents to be the calm in this stormy market.A market shift is on the horizon. Though economists are anticipating a recession, remember that a recession does not equal a housing crisis. What does this mean for you as a real estate agent? As experts in the real estate field, our No. 1 responsibility is to inform and educate our clients when a market shift occurs. We have to be the voice of reason providing facts and data to our clients. Let’s look at the data to put things into perspective.Home values continued to appreciate during four of the last six recessions in the U.S. Home values declined in the 1990s by less than 2%, and then again in 2008. Anyone who remembers the 2008 crash may think we’re headed that way again. However, it’s up to us to educate ourselves and our clients to ease those fears and help them understand what is actually happening and how it can affect their buying and selling decisions.“Make sure your clients know you are the expert when it comes to a shifting market.”Market conditions are not the same as they were leading up to the 2008 crisis. A shortage of inventory, tighter lending regulations, and lower interest rates all have contributed to the current market frenzy. Even if home appreciation starts to slow, there’s no indication it will decline. Make sure your clients know you are the expert when it comes to a shifting market. Share facts on social media, through videos, and in your newsletters. Connect with your past clients and your sphere of influence and ask them to share your content to reach more people. Don’t be afraid to have conversations about the market. Your friends and family will trust you as the expert if you are basing your conversations on facts.If you’d like to have a more in-depth conversation about changing markets and what data you should be sharing with your clients, reach out to us by phone or email. Our coaches will share information to help you be the industry expert and keep your clients informed. And remember: It’s Not the Market…it’s the Marketing That Makes the Difference!",

        "content": "All buyer’s agents should be doing this in our competitive market.I speak with agents every day who have the same issues: They’re struggling to get their buyers’ offers accepted in this challenging market. I’ve started diving deeper into why so many agents are struggling and what we can do to help change that. Today I’m excited to share that I’ve discovered a solution that has helped several agents win more deals.I recommend that you have a sit-down buyer presentation before showing them homes. It sounds simple, and you might be thinking that it won’t really help, but here’s the thing: Most agents don’t have a solid plan for their clients. Instead, they just scramble to schedule the next showing without properly educating the buyers about the process and what kind of offers they should be making to win.“You’re the expert, and you have to prove that to your clients.”With this initial meeting, you’re able to solely focus on your buyers and their specific needs. Then you can take the time to educate them on the process, the market, and the strategies they need to win. It doesn’t matter if your clients have bought a home in the past or not; by taking the time to understand their situation and explaining what you’ll do every day to help them buy a house, you’ll build trust.Once that trust is established, clients are more likely to take your advice when making offers. Provide data, facts, and success stories from past clients as well. You’re the expert, and you have to prove that to your clients to separate yourself from the competition. The only way to get clients prepared to make the necessary quick decisions in the market is to take time to get to know their needs and demonstrate your value.If you have any questions about how to structure a buyer presentation to highlight your strengths, contact my team today for a free business strategy session. If you have any other questions about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. Remember, it’s not the market; it’s the marketing that makes the difference!",

        "content": "Here’s how you can win listings in a low-inventory real estate market. Every week on my coaching calls, my agents ask me the same question: “How can I win more listings?” In a low-inventory market like this one, most agents are struggling to secure solid leads. However, my team has thrived in this environment. Today I want to share my secret for winning listings in this market. Real estate is a tough industry. Everything runs on competition, and it’s easy to feel like you’re completely by yourself. I believe in doing things a different way. By sharing ideas and strategies, my team focuses on cooperation and making everyone better in the long run.“If you use the same sales pitch at every listing appointment, you’ll just sound like every other agent. ”The key to winning consistent listings is to give your sellers exit strategies. No two sellers are the same. Some sellers want the most money possible no matter what. Others want good terms, extra moving time, or a quick sale. Because every seller is unique, you have to provide different solutions for their potential problems. If you use the same sales pitch at every listing appointment, you’ll just sound like every other agent out there. You have to provide several exit strategies for your potential sellers. This approach has allowed my team to stand out for years, but it has become even more valuable during this difficult market. If you would like to learn more about how you can provide exit strategies for your sellers, please call or email my team. My coaches will learn what makes you unique and help you craft a sales pitch based on your strengths. We look forward to hearing from you.",

Every buyer’s agent I speak with wants to know how they can be more successful in this market. They’re all coming up against the same obstacles as everyone else: low inventory and fierce competition. So what can you do?The secret is daily coaching over real-time situations. Many agents aren’t getting the support and coaching they need to thrive in this market. It’s not easy to be an agent; you need to be knowledgeable and creative to close deals. If you aren’t surrounding yourself with industry experts who can help you adapt, you won’t be as successful. You need coaches who have experience with real-life scenarios and market changes. These coaching sessions need to be frequent. Daily coaching is best, but weekly coaching is alright too.“You don’t have to struggle alone in this competitive market.”The market is changing rapidly, and you need to keep up. Unless you’ve been in this business for more than 10 years, you probably haven’t seen changes like we’re currently experiencing. You need to surround yourself with agents who can help you tackle everyday challenges like getting creative with your offers, finding inventory in a seller’s market, winning listings with difficult sellers, managing rent-backs, handling appraisal waivers, and dealing with as-is inspections.You can’t invent the scenarios we encounter as agents, so you need to find someone who is active in the business and succeeding despite the challenging market. Our coaches here at Exit First Realty offer free daily coaching to anyone interested.

        "content": "Discussing five ways you can improve your social media marketing.With the focus on social media in today’s world, if you’re not elevating your online presence, you’ll miss out on business. However, some agents find social media intimidating and don’t know where to start. Today I’ll give you five tips on mastering social media marketing:1. Just do it. Whether you have an existing page or you’re just starting out, be prepared to learn and adapt. Many agents have the idea that everything needs to be perfect before posting. In reality, they just need to start doing and make changes as needed. You should first decide what you want your audience to take away from your account, then create a theme for your social media brand. This will help you formulate ideas for content to create. 2. Set boundaries. Most people will be interested in your personal life, not just your real estate business. Social media is most successful when your goal is to connect to people, not just sell to them, so include content about your family, hobbies, and interests. However, you need to think about your limits and what parts of your life you’re not comfortable sharing. Keep in mind that extreme opinions about any topic on your social media may alienate potential clients.3. Strive to be authentic and consistent. Your photos and posts don’t have to be staged and perfect. Your audience will relate to you as a person. Don’t be afraid to share when you’re uncomfortable or nervous. Exposing those moments will make you engaging, and people will connect with you more. Consistency will help you maintain a presence and build trust. Find relatable things to post about at least three times a week.“Your audience will relate to you as a person.”4. Evaluate and repeat. Get comfortable asking and receiving feedback from your followers. No one expects you to get everything right from the start. Learn what your audience is connecting with, then repeat similar content to increase that connection. Pay attention to what time of day you’re getting the best engagement and try to post on that schedule.5. Be a storyteller. Tell the story behind your photos and clients. This helps your audience resonate with the experience of buying or selling a home and what your business is like behind the scenes. Be proud of your accomplishments and share why they make your career worthwhile. This helps create that genuine connection that will make people want to work with you.If you’d like to further discuss how to increase your social media presence, contact my team by phone or email for a free business strategy session. Our coaches will help you create a social media strategy that achieves your goals and boosts your business. ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you want to increase the success of your business, plan ahead.All highly successful people plan their days in advance. The more precise your planning is, the more successful you’ll be. Time blocking is a great way to start; all you have to do is create your schedule by blocking out times for certain activities.For example, if you block two hours in the morning for prospecting, you need to plan exactly what lead sources you’ll call during that time. You could, say, block out the hour between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. for calling internet leads like Zillow or Realtor.com. Then you could block the hour between 11 a.m. and noon to call past clients or your sphere of influence. With your past clients and sphere, make sure you write down the exact names of the people you’re calling so that you’re keeping a continuous rotation of connection with your clients.Use the same formula for every block of time in your calendar, including time for marketing activities, showings, listing/buyer appointments, etc. Also, make sure to include a block for follow-up time. For many agents, the issue isn’t a lack of leads but rather a lack of follow-up. We all speak to people who tell you to call them next week or that they’ll call you in a couple of days. Take a minute to go forward to that time in your calendar and create a “heard from” category for your follow-up. Then, write that person’s name down in your “follow-up” block so that you know to touch base when you said you would. That helps to ensure that leads don’t fall through the cracks.“All highly successful people plan their days in advance.”No matter what kind of calendar you use—whether it’s a high-tech internet calendar or an old school calendar book (like mine)—writing down precisely what you are going to do and when you are going to do it will increase your success.Taking time every evening to plan your next day in advance will help you stay on track with your goals, and it will alleviate stress.

You should already be putting a plan in place now; that way you can be ahead of the game once the new year starts.I’ve spoken with many agents during my coaching sessions who wait until the new year starts before creating a plan to increase their business.  While that’s never a bad time to put a plan in place, I encourage everyone to start before the new year begins.“Your success in the first quarter will help determine your success for the rest of the year.”Think about the end of this year and the beginning of next year as just another quarter.  As you may have seen in one of my previous videos, it’s critical to set quarterly goals to maintain your momentum throughout the year. If you want to be successful in 2022, setting and implementing a plan for the first quarter NOW is imperative. Your success in the first quarter will help determine your success for the rest of the year.Also, make sure to create specific action steps to achieve your goals, then implement those action steps so that when the new year comes, you are already working on your plan. No matter what you want to achieve in 2022, you can make it happen by creating a plan, having an accountability partner, and measuring your activities or progress.If you would like to meet with one of our coaches for a FREE business planning session to help you create a strategy for 2022, or if you have any questions, give us a call or send us an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are my thoughts on the right way to build a strong referral network.Several agents have reached out asking me to expand on an idea I shared recently about building a referral network. It’s not only important to surround yourself with trusted professionals, but it’s also important to lean into those local connectors to get referrals. As we grow our businesses, most of us gather a list of preferred vendors that we know, trust, and refer business to. These people should be referring business to you as well. It’s a great way to grow your business from the inside out. I’m diving deeper into how to set up such a network today.One of our coaching strategies is to build an entire network of business owners that aren’t necessarily in the real estate world but can exchange referrals and support each other’s businesses. Referrals don’t require a lot of money, and the return is often double or triple the effort you invest. Think of your connectors like bird dogs that are constantly on the lookout for new clients to send your way.“Teach them how to refer clients to you.”Who should be in your referral network? Obviously, there are home contractors like landscapers, electricians, roofers, and plumbers. They send clients to you, and you send clients to them. I also encourage you to think outside the box. Reach out to restaurant owners, local shops, insurance brokers, teachers, firefighters, and even nurses. Think of anyone you know working in a field where they come in contact with lots of people. These people tend to make friends easily and are great referral partners.The goal is to be top of mind when someone is thinking of selling a home. That’s why you should meet with your connectors on a regular basis. Take them to lunch, have a Zoom meeting, and keep in contact so that they think of you when they’re talking about real estate. It’s also important to ask what you can do for their business and how to refer them. Then teach them how to refer clients to you. Most importantly, make sure you reward your connectors for referrals they send your way even if it doesn’t end in a transaction. Give them a small token of appreciation every time they give your name out so that they will keep sending you potential business.If you’d like to learn some more of the finer details about building a great referral network, reach out today and schedule a free business-planning strategy session.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are five ways to generate more leads for your business.Several agents I coach have recently asked me for ideas to generate seller leads in order to find more listings. I shared with them the five creative strategies that have worked for me and my team to fill our pipeline with potential seller clients, and today I’ll pass them along to you as well:1. Establish connections in local Facebook groups. Join as many local Facebook groups as you can—groups for hobbies you and your family enjoy, as well as groups for buying, selling, and trading. Position yourself as a real estate resource and educator, not a salesperson. Look for neighborhood communities or pages like “Moving to Richmond, VA” or “New to Bon Air, Virginia,” for example.2. Keep in touch with past clients. You need to be a real estate educator and inform your past clients about their current home value. Keep them in the loop about any market changes so that they know to work with you when they’re ready to sell and/or refer friends and family to you.3. Build local partnerships and create a “preferred vendor” list. You know the phrase, “It’s all about who you know”? Well, when it comes to listings in particular, it’s especially true. Establish relationships with local restaurants, small businesses, non-profits, law offices, contractors, etc. Create a network where you all bring business to each other and strengthen that bond.“Position yourself as a real estate resource and educator, not a salesperson.”4. Leverage opportunities in your local hangouts. This goes hand-in-hand with No. 3, but it’s more specific to local stores and restaurants. Is there a certain coffee shop that you visit every morning or a restaurant that you and your family frequent? Promote and tag them on social media when you visit. Make sure to introduce yourself to the staff and be friendly. More importantly, let them know that you’re a local real estate expert. These connections will come back around when the owners and staff hear of someone looking to sell their home.5. Feature testimonials from happy clients. Post reviews everywhere you can, and make sure that your search engine, social media, and Zillow profiles are up to date with business information. You’d be shocked to learn how many agents that I’ve coached haven’t updated any of that information in a very long time. Then, post reviews from your clients on social media and make sure they’re highlighted on your business websites. Consider adding a step in your transaction process to ask for reviews on these sites, and try offering a free T-shirt with your logo or a gift card as an incentive for your clients to leave a review.If you’d like to discuss more specific ideas of how to find more listings for your business, contact us for a free strategy call.

        "content": "Here’s how you can grow your business without outside lead generation.Are you growing your business from inside out or outside in? Are you relying too much on internet leads or other outside sources? If so, there is an easier, better way to grow your business by leveraging opportunities with your existing clients.Too often I speak with agents who chase lots of outside lead sources: internet leads, paid referral companies, or the next best lead source. Some of these are good to have as an option, but many agents are simply missing opportunities to leverage business from what they already have. Some of the easiest income comes from family, friends, and current clients. You should focus your energy on getting everything you can from those sources.One way is to ask for referrals numerous times throughout the entire transaction. Ask the question, “Who else do you know that needs to buy or sell a home?” “Your time is best spent squeezing business out of what you have rather than chasing the newest thing.”On top of this, you can go above and beyond to make them feel appreciated. Throw a housewarming party for them and get to know their friends and family, send a gift to your client’s work with your branding and information celebrating their purchase, and touch base with your clients through a notecard on the anniversary of their close. These are all great ways to capture more business from these clients.Set up a system for regularly connecting with your friends, family, and neighbors to ask for referrals. Make yourself available and known as a real estate expert. They might not need to buy or sell, but they might know someone who does. You have to remind and teach them to send referrals your way.As someone who has learned the hard way, trust me when I say your time is best spent squeezing business out of what you have rather than chasing the newest thing. You’ll see a higher return on investment and better growth in the long run. Call us today for a free business strategy session.

Maybe you’re thinking of getting into real estate, but fear you won’t have the safety net of a regular paycheck. If so, Exit First Realty has a solution to help.I speak with agents outside of our brokerage frequently who are stuck on the commission roller coaster. They work very hard to generate new business for a short amount of time, but once they get a few clients, they shift their focus and ignore building their pipeline. Once transactions with those clients close, they have to start all over again. This creates inconsistent income.“If you don’t have a system in place to constantly generate income, you’ll end up struggling.”I also speak with people who are thinking of starting a real estate career but they’re worried about shifting from a consistent salaried or hourly wage into a commission-only income. At Exit First Realty, we’ve broken the cycle of the commission roller coaster and have created and implemented coaching systems that teach agents how to continuously generate a pipeline of business that can sustain them throughout the year and eliminate those ups and downs.Many people are enticed by a career in real estate because of the freedom to set your own schedule and be your own boss, but honestly, if you don’t have a system in place to constantly generate income, you’ll end up struggling. We’re always looking to grow our family with talented agents who want to take advantage of every opportunity that real estate can afford. It’s a great business but only if you implement the strategies that create consistency.If you’re interested in learning more about how our Exit First Reality family can help break the commission roller coaster, or if you’re thinking about getting into real estate but want to make sure you’re set up for success, join us for a live office meet and greet.

During my “unstuck” coaching calls with agents, I talk about goals and accountability with them after every quarter. You see, many agents tend to focus on past success without putting action plans in place to leverage future business. They work “in their business” as opposed to “on their business,” which leads to opportunities for growth. Today I have some tips to help set yourself up for real estate success for the rest of 2021:1. Know your numbers. Most agents who want to get to the next level are not 100% sure where their business is coming from. It’s important to look to the past to find out what’s been working so you can set up measurable habits going forward. 2. Create habits and activities to leverage your success into future business. This will help you grow to the next phase. Our coaches work with agents to set up scorecards with specific activities that help measure future success. They’re set up in 12-week increments, with goals for each quarter. “Reach out today to have an “unstuck” call with me or one of my agents.”The purpose is to measure each activity that needs to be completed weekly in order to generate new business. The activities on your scorecard should include strategies that you’ve earned business with in the past as well as new ideas to push you forward to the next level. You should also have an accountability coach to ensure you’re creating the right scorecard for your goals.When you focus on habits, leverage past success into future business, and set a plan in place to actively work on building that success with a system to hold you accountable, you’re guaranteed to see results.If you’d like to have an “unstuck” call with me or one of my agents to help get a plan in place to leverage your success to future business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

        "content": "Here are three tasks you can do to boost your motivation and get unstuck. Do you have a problem with consistent lead generation? If so, I have a solution to help you get unstuck. I recently had a strategy call with an agent. She told me her biggest problem was the lack of consistent lead generation. I see this all the time with agents, especially in this market. You see agents get busy and they struggle to keep up their daily prospecting habits. Speaking with this particular agent, I learned that she connects with people quickly and easily builds trust. She got into real estate because she loves her kids and wants to add extra income for her family, but she doesn’t like prospecting. I asked her about her goals. She said that she wants to sell 25 homes a year. That’s an awesome goal and very attainable with the right systems and coaching, but there’s a disconnect. She’s been an agent for over 10 years and she has consistently sold only two to four homes per year.When asked why she’s only selling two to four homes per year, she gets frustrated and says she doesn’t know why. She understands the business and she knows what to do, she just always ends up stuck at that level of business. My best guess is that’s her comfort level of income, and that drives her activities. Even though she wants to earn more, her internal voice says to wait and slow down. She is unconsciously holding herself back from pushing forward to her goals. I came up with a solution that may help her and anyone else who’s in a similar situation.“These three tasks can help you start focusing on why you want to reach your goals.”We have to think about our brain and our habits like a computer hard drive that holds all the data. When the hard drive is new, it’s smooth and blank. As information is gathered, it’s grooved onto the disk. If you want to put new information on the disk, you can’t erase the old material. You have to write new data on top of the old by scratching a new groove. Write over the old thoughts that are holding you back with these three tips.1. Put a picture of your “why” on your desk or work area. My colleague’s kids are her “why.” She needs to see them every day to know what she’s working for.2. Create a “why” income sheet. Take a piece of paper and write your income and goal at the top. Make a long list of reasons why you want this money, what it will do for your family, and how your life will change. Let your thoughts flow freely to help rewrite your hard drive.3. Create a vision board. Get a giant poster board and fill it with pictures of things you want to attain. Get your family involved. They should help you with your vision for the future. Keep the board in a place where you’ll see it every day.Give yourself a deadline to complete each step and have a partner who can hold you accountable for keeping your deadline. This will not solve your problem overnight, but it is a step in the right direction. These three tasks can help you rewrite your hard drive to start focusing on why you want to reach your goals.If you’re feeling stuck, contact me for a free “unstuck” call and business strategy session. I will help you rewrite your hard drive and keep you accountable. I look forward to boosting your success.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Four tips for agents to help their buyers get their offers accepted. We all know the market is crazy right now. I speak with agents every day who are struggling with the same issue of how to help buyers get their offers accepted. Here are some tips and tricks that our agents use that have been working.1. Make sure you call the listing agent. I know this might seem like a no-brainer but you’d be surprised how often it doesn’t happen. As a listing agent, I don’t always get a call from the buyer’s agent. Before an offer is submitted, call the agent and ask what specific terms the sellers want. It also helps to foster a relationship with the other agent. Let them know that you and your buyers are willing to work together in whatever it takes to get a deal done. It also allows you to negotiate terms like rent-backs, response times, contingencies, or things that can be favorable to the sellers, thereby putting your buyer in a better position to win. It’s not always about the sales price; better terms or contingencies can win out over a higher price.2. Offer a higher earnest money deposit or EMD. The EMD shows sellers that your buyers have skin in the game and that they’re serious. A higher EMD deposit means that the buyers are willing to put that money on the line in case something goes wrong with the contract. This shows the sellers that they’re willing to financially commit to the deal upfront.“Many agents are struggling with the same issue right now.”3. Include a buyer love letter with your offer. Sometimes appealing to the seller’s emotions can make the difference when winning bids. It’s hard to believe, but I recently had a seller accept an offer that was slightly lower in sales price because the buyer wrote a heartfelt letter and included a picture of their family dog. You see, buying and selling a home is an emotional experience and sometimes it can help to enhance those emotions. If possible, have your buyers write a letter to the seller about what they love in the house and how they can envision their lives living there. Make sure to include the letter all in one document with your offer and contract so the seller has no choice but to review them together.4. If possible, include an escalation clause with your offer. You should discuss this with your clients and with the listing agent first. I have seen several bids won recently because of escalation clauses. Let’s say your buyer is pre-approved and willing to pay $475,000 for a home. You write an offer for $465,000 without an escalator. Then another offer comes in at $470,000 and wins. Would your clients really want to miss out on their dream home because of 5,000 dollars? Probably not. It’s best to have this conversation with them and offer an escalation clause of X amount over another offer up to a certain point. This can help put your buyers in the best position up front without having to constantly go back and forth in negotiations.These are just some tricks to your buyers win bids. It’s not always about the sales price. We at EXIT First Realty offer daily FREE coaching like this to help you close more deals.

        "content": "Closing more deals starts with daily coaching. Throughout the years of working on my business and building my team, I’ve found that one of the most successful ways agents can increase their sales and grow their business is through daily coaching. Think of it like a sports team: You need to practice every day and constantly review your strategy to win. The same goes for real estate. You need a foundation to build on and a way to implement slight-edge, street-smart techniques so you can constantly improve. Most real estate companies offer monthly coaching or some initial training and then send you out to sell homes without much follow-up or support. Here at Exit First Realty, we understand that many agents need more frequent support in order to be successful in this business. We believe in treating each other like family so we can all benefit from each other’s experience. The more you know, the more you grow, the more money you can make. Our coaches are actively producing agents dealing with the same situations and pain points all other agents face. We’ve created a street-smart strategy based on current sales situations, and we pass those onto you so you can close more deals. “One of the most successful ways agents can increase their sales and grow their business is through daily coaching.”We’ve found that agents who take advantage of our daily coaching and accountability see a significant increase in their business. It helps you to be proactive instead of reactive, and it helps you to better serve your clients over time. Our daily coaching is available free of charge, and we discuss current sales situations and issues, how to win more bids in this competitive buyer’s market, how to find more seller clients, and how to close more deals. Whatever you’re having trouble with, our family of experienced agents can help you find a solution. If you feel like you’re not receiving enough support or could use a boost in your accountability, contact us today to set up a coaching session. You can call, email, or visit our website richmondrealestatejobs.com.If you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well.

        "content": "Here are eight skills every great real estate agent needs to master. We all know the past year has been a challenging time in the real estate market. Through my time coaching agents, I’ve identified eight specific skills that agents must master in order to maintain success in any type of market:1. Laser focus. You have to be proactive and focus on conquering one thing at a time.2. Intense market knowledge. You need to memorize those important market stats and be able to share them with others confidently.3. Extreme urgency. In this fast-paced market, you have to have that urgency every moment of the day to help your clients win.4. High Organization. You need to structure your day, stick to your calendar, and use technology to help you stay on track.“Agents need to be the calm voice of reason in a transaction.”5. Negotiations and problem solving. You have to be the best possible advocate for your clients and problem solve based on your past experiences.6. Honesty. This one should go without saying, but you’d be surprised at the dishonesty we see. Make sure you’re an agent who provides true, accurate, and unbiased information to your client.7. Emotional intelligence. It’s a very busy time and agents are losing their cool. We need to stay calm and be the voice of reason, as well as the source of the information.8. Leadership. Be professional for your clients. Don’t take anything personally, and give perspective to edge out the competition.If you have any questions about these eight skills or anything else related to the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "With our coaching, you can and will make more money.I speak with agents at other brokerages all the time who are making 100% commission but still aren’t where they want to be in their business. I like to pose a question to them: “Would you rather make 100% commission while closing an average of, say, 18 deals per year, or would it be better to make 80% to 90% while closing 24 to 36 deals a year?”Here at Exit First Realty, our track record proves that agents who join our team and participate in our free weekly coaching sessions see a 50% to 100% increase in their volumes over the previous year. It’s so important to continually learn and grow so that you can increase the number of clients that you serve. Wouldn’t you rather have more satisfied clients who refer business to you?Our coaching will also teach you how to turn your past clients into raving fans. It’s a lot better to have 36 clients who appreciate you and will send you referrals than having just 18 clients who might send you referrals. Our coaching teaches you how to have more reach, nurture your past clients, and leverage your business to the next level. By doing this, our Exit Realty agents also see another 25% to 50% increase in their business in their second year with our company. Our coaching is tailored to where you are in your business and where you want to go. We add additional coaching to ensure that you get to the next level. The more you know, the more you grow.As I mentioned before, our coaching is free to all our agents. You’ll get real-life, street-smart strategies that you can implement in your business now to help you close more deals. Our coaches are active agents who are also working in their business and writing deals daily. We utilize real-world examples to give our agents a slight edge over their competition.“Our coaching can help you close more deals, which means you make more money.”Let’s run the numbers. The average sale price in Richmond, Virginia, is around $300,000, and the average commission rate is 3%—that’s $9,000 per deal. If you’re closing 15 deals a year with 100% take-home commission, you’re making a yearly gross commission of around $135,000. Not bad at all! But could it be better?Now let’s look at what you could make at Exit Realty, where agents take home an average of 85% commission (though some make more, and some make less). Using the same $300,000 average sale price with a 3% commission rate, you’d make about $7,650 per deal. With our coaching, you can close 25 deals a year very easily, meaning your yearly gross commission would be $191,250. That’s over $56,000 more than you’re making right now. Even with the average 85% take-home commission, our coaching can help you close more deals, which means you make more money.Once you become more successful, your numbers will go up even more. By closing 36 deals a year—only three deals each month—your yearly gross commission goes up to $250,000. That’s more than double what you might be making right now.As you grow, you’re also likely to sell higher-priced homes, which means your commissions would be even higher. Exit Realty’s commission structure is set up so that your take-home commission actually increases to 90% when you reach a certain gross commission income.If you’re interested in learning more about how Exit Realty’s coaching systems can help you close more deals, contact us today. You can even schedule a free business strategy call to run your specific business numbers and see how we can help you grow.   ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you want consistent business, you need to diversify your lead generation sources.I speak with real estate agents all the time who struggle to source their next deal. They may have a good follow-up system and be great at providing first-class service, but they struggle with the ups and downs of finding consistent business. This is a common problem for not just agents, but anyone who works in commission-based sales. They always seem to be chasing the next lead or trying to convert leads from the same resource. One of the main coaching strategies we teach here at Exit First Realty is having multiple lead generation sources, or “lead buckets.” You can’t be one-dimensional in your real estate lead generation.Think of it like fishing: If you want to catch the most fish, you need to have multiple lines in the water with multiple types of bait, all working at the same time. The same holds true for real estate. As agents, we need to be working several different lead sources in order to build a pipeline of consistent business. For example, here are some of the lead generation systems we coach:  Investment real estate. This gives you many different options: buy-and-hold properties, flipping properties, property management, etc.  How to effectively geo-farm or work a target neighborhood.   Properly managing your social media to passively generate leads. I’m not talking about just posting something here and there; I’m talking about truly making your social media a lead generation resource.  How to turn open house leads into loyal clients. I run across agents all the time who insist that open houses don’t work, but the agents I coach have great success with open houses so long as they use our coaching methods.  Turning past clients into consistent referral business. “You can’t be one-dimensional in your real estate lead generation.”If you don’t have at least four or five lead generation sources you’re consistently working, you won’t be consistently successful. Make sure you cast out multiple fishing lines with different bait to bring in business from several areas. Our coaching strategies are proven to help agents earn steady business and avoid the up-and-down nature of commissions. There are dozens of opportunities for stable business income—you just have to know where to reach them and how to convert them. If you’re interested in learning more about how Exit First Realty’s unique coaching can help you generate more leads, call, email, or visit richmondrealestatejobs.com. I also invite you to schedule a free one-on-one coaching session via Zoom. I look forward to hearing from you. Remember: It’s not the market, it’s the marketing that makes the difference. ",

        "content": "Here’s the backstory on why I keep a belt display in my office.Have you ever wondered why I have a Tae-Kwon-Do colored belt system on display behind me in almost every one of my videos? I can promise you it’s not for bragging rights or to show off; it’s used as a coaching tool for all of our agents here at Exit First Realty. For some time now, I’ve been coaching agents on strategies to grow their business, but it was through a conversation with our office manager that the perfect method became clear to me. Like me, our office manager is a student of Tae-Kwon-Do, and one day she observed that the perpetual pursuit of mastery in the real estate industry is analogous to the martial art belt system. Oftentimes, young martial arts practitioners who experience a little bit of success get ahead of themselves and try to skip a few levels; everyone wants to be a black belt overnight, but there are no shortcuts. Step-by-step growth is just as important in the real estate world. Ultimately, we ended up tailoring our coaching to the respective level of each of our agents. For example, a newer agent who might be a white or orange belt has struggles that are totally different from the challenges a red belt is facing. We meet agents where they’re at, and we approach all problems with the same level of respect and determination. “Everyone wants to be a black belt overnight, but there are no shortcuts.”The last thing we want to do is treat our variously skilled agents as a monolith, blasting them with the same generic messages and expecting them to grow somehow. However, from our experience, we’ve found that most agents do tend to get stuck in a rut in the same areas. Green belt, for example, is a common plateau; agents at that level begin experiencing serious success and find themselves busier than ever, but often fall into the trap of slacking on their prospecting duties. Red belts or those who have received what’s called a “Bodan,” which is right below a black belt, can get stuck in the worst way: losing any sense of how to grow beyond what they’ve already achieved. More often than not, adopting slight-edge strategies for things such as time management will give them the boost they need to move up even further. Becoming a “black belt Realtor” is a process that can take up to three or four years—again, there are no “fast passes” or shortcuts. Agents must fully experience every rung of the ladder in order to become well-rounded. We have a very good record of helping people become black belts, and the ones who succeed are always the ones who put in the time. They’re not necessarily more skilled or talented than anyone else, they’re simply diligent, tenacious, and focused. A true black belt understands that they still haven’t reached their final destination. They can yet grow to the second-, third-, fourth-, or fifth-degree level and beyond. Though the challenges may change, there’s no end to the pursuit of mastery; we get better every day, and we learn from each other. If you want to learn more about how Exit First Realty can help you get to the next belt level in your business, contact us today—I promise we won’t hit you with any real Tae-Kwon-Do moves! Just give us a call or send an email to get the conversation started. I’m even offering a free, one-on-one business strategy session via Zoom for anyone who’s interested. Let’s all aspire to be better at our craft in 2021.",

Exit First Realty is real estate humanized. Our goal as an organization is to build strong, successful agents who are financially free. We care about our agents to the point where we refer to our brokerage as a family disguised as a real estate company. The way we implement this goal is by creating unique coaching strategies that are tailored to each agent’s needs and objectives. Many companies offer a one-size-fits-all approach to training. They firehose you with information at the beginning and then tell you to try making it on your own without offering much follow-up coaching or training to help you reach the next level. Our approach is different. While we do offer initial training, it’s tailored to your specific behavioral style, preferred method of learning, and goals for your business. Then we take it a step further: Every agent is assigned a mentor or coach who provides specific guidance to help you reach the next level—similar to how it’s done in martial arts. We even have a training system based on belt levels. We work together as a family and team to help each other grow.“Exit First Realty is real estate humanized.”We pull the best coaching methods from other systems and combine them with our Exit flair so they work for our agents. Our office also partners with national and international coaching operations. We take advice from these titans of industry and boil it down to specific action plans we share with our agents free of charge. We then have daily, weekly, and monthly coaching sessions each agent is encouraged to attend, including:  Online webinars  Face-to-face meetings with your coach  Team-building exercises  Individual growth plans that push you to always get better in your craftWe want our agents to succeed in business, and we want our coaching to get better every day as well. That’s why we’re always following other coaching systems and making updates to the strategies we offer other agents.

We also understand that our job as a family is to foster those goals and help you succeed, no matter what level you strive to reach. If you’re interested in learning more about our Exit First Realty family and how to take advantage of our unique coaching plans, please contact us today.

This thing is, now is actually the most important time for you to refocus your energy, create a solid business plan, and put an accountability system in place so you can start next year with a bang. We all know the market is bustling as we make our way through fall, but there is some volatility on the horizon. With the upcoming presidential election and foreseeable market inconsistencies, it’s more important than ever to provide facts to your clients and establish good daily activities so you can be the expert to guide them through this uncertainty. Most clients and potential clients are hearing conflicting information about future real estate market predictions. There is some misinformation out there indicating that home prices may plummet, mortgage rates may increase drastically, and the market may slow down significantly. Some clients were personally affected by the market crash of 2008 (or know someone who was affected) and still harbor a strong memory that it may happen again. As real estate professionals, it’s our job to be knowledgeable brokers and provide hard facts about the market. You should use that data to ease your clients’ fears and continue to drive your business forward. For example, roughly 42% of all U.S. homeowners own their homes free and clear, and about 90% of all mortgages have at least 10% to 15% equity. This means most homeowners can walk away with profit even if they were forced to sell. Current market conditions aren’t the same as they were in 2008, so another market crash is unlikely.“Now is actually the most important time for you to refocus your energy, create a solid business plan, and put an accountability system in place so you can start next year with a bang.”This is the kind of data I share with my agents weekly so they can help guide their clients through any uncertainty. It’s also imperative for agents to create habits and implement systems now to ensure future success regardless of market changes. This means you need to create a business plan that can account for any uncertainty and get a coach who can hold you accountable to your plan. You also need to keep up your daily activities (e.g., prospecting, scorecard tracking, and rigorous calendar blocking) to grow your business in 2021. As a real estate coach, I provide tools you can use to continue your success as we head into the new year. I will work with you to create a plan and help hold you accountable for your actions. I guarantee I can help you close more deals next year even if the market changes significantly. By the way, I provide all of this for free!You can join me every Wednesday for my weekly agent help session from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. I host these sessions via Zoom and answer any questions about where the market is headed and how you can set up systems to stay ahead of the curb.

        "content": "Here’s my advice for agents struggling with setting client expectations.If you’re a real estate agent who’s struggling with managing your clients’ expectations in this crazy real estate market, you’re not alone (and you’re in luck). Today I have some great tips and advice for you to help your buyers and sellers navigate our current climate.With today’s hot seller’s market in Richmond, it can be challenging to manage your clients’ expectations. I’ve been there. It’s important to provide specific information so they can be prepared for what to expect. Here are my best tips:1. Setting expectations with your buyers. It’s up to you as the professional to set the proper expectations for your buyers. With inventory so low, there is a lot of competition for homes, so you need to help set realistic goals, and let them know they could lose out on a home even if they give their best bid. If you haven’t done so already, take some time to educate yourself on how to craft a strong offer. A good coach can teach you how to do this easily and effectively.2. Setting expectations with your sellers. It’s also up to you to provide up-to-date information on current market conditions for your sellers. This way, they know exactly what’s happening in their neighborhood. Not all homes are selling quickly everywhere, and not every home seller is getting what they think their home is worth. An accurate CMA can help set the right expectations for your sellers.“You need to provide real-time data and statistics.”3. Be the source of the source. No matter whether you’re representing buyers or sellers, you want to be the source of the source of information. You need to be able to provide real-time data and statistics for your clients while also allowing them to come to their own conclusions about what decision to make. I can teach you how to do this.I have experience helping agents become better through education, training, and mentorship. If you want to learn more about how I can help you take your business to the next level, don’t hesitate to reach out for a free business coaching lesson. I promise it’s not a high-pressure recruiting pitch, just a simple evaluation of your business to do with what you will.If you have any other questions about the business for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

Could you benefit from an accounting plan as well as specific strategies to help you grow your business to the next level?If you said yes to any of those questions, I invite you to join me for a free agent help session held every Wednesday.You see, if you’re not constantly trying to improve yourself—even by just 1%—then how can you achieve your goals?I speak with agents every day who have had big ideas and want to reach the next level of their careers but who lacked a solid plan or a means of holding themselves accountable.I’ve been holding these weekly help sessions for over two months now, and several agents who have attended have been able to expand their businesses more than ever.“What I’m offering is free advice that is specifically tailored to your business to allow you to move to the next level.”For example, I have one agent who isn’t even with Exit First Realty who has attended every session. She’s been in the business for over 18 years and was doing an average of four or five deals a year. She even paid another coach $2,000 for a program that just wasn’t successful for her. After a few weeks of attending my weekly help sessions, she implemented specific strategies with action steps into her business that have already increased her closed deals and profits this year.Many companies promise a 100% commission, but they often lack the support and coaching needed to really leverage your success. What I’m offering is free advice that is specifically tailored to your business to allow you to move to the next level.I’ll also provide you with more accountability, support, and opportunities so that you can have the freedom to workon **your business*—not necessarily *in your business.This is not an effort to recruit you to my company, although there are ways to grow your business by building passive income with Exit First Realty, if you’re interested.

        "content": "If you want to crush your goals for the second half of2020, here are the four rules you must remember. 1. Master your morning routine. Set a schedule and stick to it. Every morning you should have the same routine to help get your mindset right. You could exercise, listen to a podcast, read an inspirational book, meditate, etc. Even making your bed is a small win that can set the tone for the rest of the day. Do whatever you need to do to get your attitude and mindset correct. 2. Check the MLS stats and hot sheets daily. You need to understand specifically what’s happening in the market and how you can provide that information to your clients. These stats will help you provide specific information when someone asks what’s happening in the market. This information will also help you assist your clients in writing offers and finding homes.“Track your activities, find a coach to hold you accountable to those activities, and your success will grow.”3. Schedule appointment setting times daily. In our office, we’re not calling it “prospecting time” anymore—we’re calling it “appointment setting time.” You need to change your mindset and substitute prospecting with appointment setting. This reinforced the mentality of setting appointments when you pick up the phone. Your sole job is to connect with prospects and get appointments. Instead of saying you’re just prospecting for two hours a day, have a goal of setting a certain number of appointments. See how much more successful you can be when changing your mindset. 4. Measure your activities and success. You’ve probably heard me talk before about accountability and knowing your numbers. If you don’t know your numbers, how can you measure success? I can’t stress enough how important it is to track your activities and progress. Sales is a numbers game, and let’s face it: We’re in a sales field. Always measure specific activities to see how they correlate with your regular sales. Know the numbers of calls, showings, and appointments that lead to contracts and sales. This actually helps you pay attention when your sales aren’t where they should be. Track your activities, find a coach to hold you accountable to those activities, and your success will grow. If you’d like to know more about how to make your business grow in 2020, I invite you to join my free agent help sessions on Zoom every Wednesday from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. I’ll answer all of your questions and offer my solutions to take your business to the next level.

        "content": "Here are a few tools that every agent should be able to utilize.I often speak with agents who have just one or two tools in their toolbox. What I mean is that they only have one or two ways of bringing in business. Having a couple will only get you so far. You need a full business toolbox to become an expert real estate agent.Some examples of these tools include:1. An accountability system. You should have a program in place to make sure you’re doing what you say you will and when you say you will do it. With my coaching clients, we set up scorecards to measure their productivity on a daily, monthly, and weekly basis.2. Multiple lead generation systems. These include internet leads, neighborhood farming, social media posts, client referrals, repeat clients, and more. It’s important to always prospect, but also attract business to you without chasing after it.“The proactive approach is best.”3. A useful CRM and autoresponders. What’s the best CRM? My answer is that a CRM you can understand and use is the best one. A CRM and autoresponders make lead generation easy and can help you gain leads passively, especially over time. 4. Ongoing regular coaching. The most important tool you can have as an agent is a guide who can help push you into growth every day. As Realtors, I feel like we tend to be pulled in many directions at once and become reactive instead of proactive. I’ve come to learn that the proactive approach is best. You need a coach to help you get better every day and give you a slight edge over your competition.These are just a few examples of the tools you can and should be adding to your toolbox as a real estate agent.

        "category": "",
        "content": "In today’s market, you should combat clients’ uncertainties with facts.With everything going on right now, it’s easy to get caught up in the media hype. Sometimes it can be hard to know what to say to ease your clients’ fears about the market. However, today I have the facts and tips that you should share with your clients to position you as the neighborhood expert and a voice of reason, which will increase your business:1. The real estate market is very active. Make sure you provide statistics that support what is truly happening right now. Info that they can’t get anywhere else but from you, the expert. Our MLS provides these stats, such as the average days on market, the current inventory level, and a daily hot sheet. Right now, inventory is extremely low and the average days on market for April and May are under 30. Homes are still selling for 95% to 100% of their list price. These stats show that the market is still hot!2. Don’t be a salesperson. Be empathetic and helpful instead. There will be prospects who want to put their home search on hold with everything going on. Respect their wishes, and continue to provide them value on a regular basis. It’s important to make a connection and talk to them, and the business will come later. They should know that you’re there to help, not just to sell.“If you can position yourself as an expert, the business will eventually come.”3. You have to stay in touch. Do you have a systematic way to regularly stay in touch with your database? The fortune is definitely in the follow up. Many people are home and available to talk, so take advantage of those opportunities while things are still shut down. You can call, send a handwritten note, mail market info to them, and provide video, text, and emails. It’s important to stay top of mind and ease their fears.The bottom line to all of this is that real estate is still moving and business is still happening. If you can position yourself as an expert by providing helpful info and making a connection, then stay in regular contact with top of mind, the business will come. If you have any questions for me about what you should say to clients or how you should position yourself, join me for one of my weekly help sessions, where you can register for at richmondrealestatejobs.com.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today let’s discuss the importance of setting small goals and using an accountability coach to achieve them.Most agents either set very lofty goals or set only one goal for a whole year at a time; for example, setting the goal to sell 25 homes or doing $1 million in sales volume a year. That can be a great starting point, but it doesn’t mean anything if you don’t break it down into quarterly, weekly, and daily goals. You need to be specific and leverage your activities to compound your success.So where do you start? We get our agents to take their big goal and then break it down into small levels of activity. For example, if you want to sell 25 homes this year and your current average is one sale a month, your new goal is more than double your current activity. That’s quite a lot bigger, so break it down into daily activities; it’s easier to commit to two hours of prospecting a day for an entire week.Also, be specific about who you’re reaching out to, be it your past clients, sphere of influence, social media, internet leads, etc. Your objective should always be to set appointments. Time block exactly when you’re going to do it next.Next, know your numbers. If it takes you four appointments to make a sale and 10 calls to set an appointment, you need to make sure you’re setting your goals based on those activities.“I’ve been in the business for over 20 years and I still meet with two coaches to hold me accountable and keep me focused.”It’s also a great idea to put your goals on paper so you can track your process. Put them somewhere accessible, like your daily calendar book or on a spreadsheet. Create a system to track your daily activities and your progress on them.Most importantly, share your goals and progress with an accountability partner. Your partner will keep you on track and push you if you fall behind. When you don’t have an accountability coach, you have no one to answer to, which makes it very easy to give up on your goals or slip into bad habits. I’ve been in the business for over 20 years and I still meet with two coaches to hold me accountable and keep me focused.If you’re interested in creating a personal business plan in accountability coaching, contact me for a free strategy session.Additionally, you’re invited to attend one of our weekly agent support sessions via Zoom, where I provide tips, tricks, and suggestions for how to take your business to the next level.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are some time blocking tips that will help you be more successful.The key to being more successful is time blocking and time management. How do you manage your time efficiently and utilize time blocking?First, you must use a calendar system. Whether it’s a calendar book or Google Calendar, you need a calendar you’ll use every day. Once you have a calendar, it’s time to schedule your “rocks.” These are the most important things that must be done every day, like prospecting, showing appointments, inspections, etc. These things are non-negotiable—don’t interfere with them. You should prospect for at least two hours, and your prospecting goal is to schedule appointments. If you’re prospecting for one hour, prospect hard and fast for 50 minutes and then take a 10-minute break. If you need to check your phone, get up and walk around, or do anything else you need to do to keep your energy up, do it during this break. The next hour, do the exact same thing. “The secret to keeping a disciplined calendar is holding yourself accountable to all scheduled activities.”When scheduling your prospecting time, you must also schedule who you’ll call specifically. This is something a lot of agents forget to do. You should know who you’ll call ahead of time so that when you’re in your prospecting zone, you’re focused and getting calls done left and right. You’d be amazed how many calls you can make by doing this. Also, don’t turn your calendar into a to-do list, where you have appointments and other things scheduled back to back all day long. You need to schedule breaks in between. What does all of this mean? Some experienced agents don’t use disciplined calendars day to day, week to week. They end up being reactive instead of proactive and don’t get the most important prospecting activities done. The secret to keeping a disciplined calendar is holding yourself accountable to all scheduled activities. On my team, our system involves a daily and weekly scorecard. If we maintain our daily successes throughout each week, we get a good score. That’s a direct indication of future business and success.If you’d like to know more about our time blocking system, don’t hesitate to call our office and book a strategy session.

        "content": "Repeat clients and referrals are one of the most reliable sources of business. Here’s what you need to do to make this a pillar of yours.If you want to generate more referral business from your past clients and sphere of influence, here are the things you must be doing:1. You need to have a CRM and database. Which CRM is the best to use? The one that you use. It’s best to have one centrally located database, too. I’ve talked to some agents who’ve used Follow Up Boss, Boomtown, and Top Producer who have all had success. It’s important to keep that database in one place, add to it every day, and make sure everyone you know is in there. “It’s important to stay in touch and always provide value.”2. Reach out to your database at least once a month. Each of our agents has a system set up to do this. It can be a text, email, phone call, or even a postcard. However, don’t use the same contact method twice in a row. Make sure these touches are scheduled in your calendar, too. It sounds easy, but I run across experienced agents every day who aren’t doing this.3. Provide value. I hear from agents all the time who hesitate to reach out to their database because they don’t know what to bring in terms of value. It can be as easy as providing the latest market numbers or listings for buyers, or quarterly stats and a home value estimate for sellers. By staying in touch and letting them know you bring value, you’ll be considered a market expert.For past clients who aren’t buying or selling right now, you want to be a resource by providing helpful, educational content. You can’t be what I call a “secret agent.” I see too many agents forget their past clients after helping them through a transaction. By keeping in touch with these people, you can earn their business over and over.With these three tips, I guarantee that you’ll get more referral business. Just stay in touch regularly and provide value. If you’d like more specific tips, just give me a call or send an email. I would love to help you take your business to the next level.",

        "content": "What’s the easiest way to get more leads? Don’t be a secret agent. To show you what I mean by that, let me tell you about how we do business at Exit First Realty.We coach our agents on how to find and generate different leads every day. We start by creating awareness that you’re in the real estate business. It could be something like wearing name tags or sticking signs on your car. Even your social media account is tagged. We also teach you how to build a database and contact that database to make sure everyone in it knows about the services you provide. This might sound basic, but you’d be surprised how many experienced agents don’t do these things. We have a proven system, with dialogues, that can turn everyday conversations into business. After you establish this foundation, we help you with your lead generation methods. What are the best open house dialogues? How do you convert internet leads? What other internet lead sources can you use to generate more leads?I’ve also had good luck with agents getting involved with an area of interest to themselves that they can network through the group. For example, we had an agent who was a horse-riding enthusiast join a horse-riding club. She got a lot of business from them, but it also helped the group in a variety of ways. She was able to volunteer and get business from like-minded people just by doing what she loved. “Don’t be a secret agent.”The point is, you have to let everyone know you work in real estate. We coach because coaching should be ongoing, just like the martial arts belt display you see behind me in the video above. I’ve practiced martial arts for roughly 20 years, and I’ve realized that real estate training is often just like martial arts training: Just like the belt system, you have to learn what to do step by step. We’ve applied this system to our office. No matter what “belt level” you are as an agent, you’re required to help other people. The belts aren’t there to show off; they’re there to demonstrate how to work each day. If you have any other questions, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to speak with you.P.S. We’d love to see you at our upcoming networking event. If you or someone you know is looking to get into real estate or grow your real estate career, come learn about who we are, what we do, and the people behind our business.
