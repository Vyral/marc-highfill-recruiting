We’re sitting down with Brett Dieringer, an outstanding Realtor on our team, once again to talk about his recent success. He’s only been in real estate for about two years, but he’s handled our difficult, changing market with ease. Brett has learned a lot from his other agents on the Exit team and has used that knowledge to adapt to our market and figure out a new way to get more leads.
