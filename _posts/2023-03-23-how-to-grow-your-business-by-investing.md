Are you looking to build more wealth in your business? Having different lead buckets or streams of business is a great way to start. In my opinion, one of the best ways is to invest in real estate. There are two benefits to investing in rental properties as an agent.

**The first is that you build long-term cash flow that grows over time.** The key is to find single-family homes in desirable school districts and buy them using a fixed-rate mortgage. Rental rates will continue to increase over the years while your mortgage payment will remain the same, meaning you get to keep more money in your pocket as the years pass.&nbsp;

The second benefit is that you can pull more clients in by becoming knowledgeable about this type of investing. By adding this niche to your business, you can leverage the relationships you build and the knowledge you gain to help more clients and close more deals.

**You don't need a ton of money to start investing,** and you can roll your commission into the deal and even partner with others to get started.
