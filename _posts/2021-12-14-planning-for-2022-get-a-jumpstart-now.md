If you want to succeed in 2022, **the first quarter determines your success**. You should already be putting a plan in place now; that way you can be ahead of the game once the new year starts.

I’ve spoken with many agents during my coaching sessions who wait until the new year starts before creating a plan to increase their business.&nbsp; While that’s never a bad time to put a plan in place, I encourage everyone to start before the new year begins.

Think about the end of this year and the beginning of next year as just another quarter.&nbsp; As you may have seen in one of my previous videos, it’s critical to set quarterly goals in order to maintain your momentum throughout the year.

If you want to be successful in 2022, setting and implementing a plan for the first quarter NOW is imperative. Your success in the first quarter will help determine your success for the rest of the year.

Also, make sure to **create specific action steps to achieve your goals**, then implement those action steps so that when the new year comes, you are already working on your plan.

No matter what you want to achieve in 2022, you can make it happen by creating a plan, having an accountability partner, and measuring your activities or progress.
