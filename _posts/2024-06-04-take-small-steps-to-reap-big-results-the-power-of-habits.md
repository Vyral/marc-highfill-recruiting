Each one of your actions and behaviors affects your business. Setting big goals for your business can be intimidating, especially if you think of all the things that you need to do to achieve them. As a real estate broker and coach, I always tell my agents to focus on small, daily habits to achieve big things.

**Set a personal scorecard.** Instead of trying to do everything all at once, make a “scorecard” with 1 to 2 important tasks that you need to complete for the day or week to push your business forward. It might be talking with new potential clients or adding a specific number of people to your database.

**Step it up by getting an accountability partner.** Asking for help from another person can help you stay on track. Lastly, you can set rewards or consequences when you meet or miss your scorecard. If you find yourself taking on too much, it’s okay to take a step back until you can accomplish your regular activities.

**Remember that habit building takes 60 to 90 days**, but once you have developed a habit, that’s where you can see growth. Achieving success doesn’t have to be scary. You just need to take advantage of the compounding effect of completing small tasks and build a habit out of it. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll be amazed at how much you have accomplished, not only in your business but personally.
