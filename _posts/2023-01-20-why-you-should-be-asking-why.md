Most real estate agents understand the value of asking good questions. Whether you’re talking to leads, talking to clients, or talking to friends and family, it’s important to ask questions so you have a better understanding of the situation. Here is one question you should be asking more often: “Why?” This simple word has huge potential to push your business forward as the market starts to normalize.

**Ask yourself:**

* Why am I in this business?
* Why are my goals important to me?
* Why will meeting my goals change my life?

The answer to these questions will help you focus on your reason for working. The more you focus on your personal “why,” the easier it will be to get through tough times.

**Ask prospective clients, or leads:**

* Why is that location important to you?
* Why do you like that style of home?
* Why will making a move help you and your family?

These questions will help you and your clients uncover motivation. Motivation is what drives decision-making. Reminding your clients of their motivation will help them act faster.

**Ask your past clients, friends, and family:**

* Why did you choose to work with me?
* Why would you recommend me to other people who need to buy or sell a home?

Use these answers to help create a personal brand, and to help you define your target client audience. Once you have that message clear, you can use it to leverage your opportunities.
