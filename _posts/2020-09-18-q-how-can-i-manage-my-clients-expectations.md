*Here’s my advice for agents struggling with setting client expectations.*

If you’re a real estate agent who’s struggling with managing your clients’ expectations in this crazy real estate market, you’re not alone (and you’re in luck). Today I have some great tips and advice for you to help your buyers and sellers navigate our current climate.

With today’s hot seller’s market in Richmond, it can be challenging to manage your clients’ expectations. I’ve been there. It’s important to provide specific information so they can be prepared for what to expect. Here are my best tips:

**1\. Setting expectations with your buyers.** It’s up to you as the professional to set the proper expectations for your buyers. With inventory so low, there is a lot of competition for homes, so you need to help set realistic goals, and let them know they could lose out on a home even if they give their best bid. If you haven’t done so already, take some time to educate yourself on how to craft a strong offer. A good coach can teach you how to do this easily and effectively.

**2\. Setting expectations with your sellers.** It’s also up to you to provide up-to-date information on current market conditions for your sellers. This way, they know exactly what’s happening in their neighborhood. Not all homes are selling quickly everywhere, and not every home seller is getting what they think their home is worth. An accurate CMA can help set the right expectations for your sellers.

**3\. Be the source of the source.** No matter whether you're representing buyers or sellers, you want to be the source of the source of information. You need to be able to provide real-time data and statistics for your clients while also allowing them to come to their own conclusions about what decision to make. I can teach you how to do this.

I have experience helping agents become better through education, training, and mentorship. If you want to learn more about how I can help you take your business to the next level, don’t hesitate to reach out for a free business coaching lesson. I promise it’s not a high-pressure recruiting pitch, just a simple evaluation of your business to do with what you will.

If you have any other questions about the business for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
