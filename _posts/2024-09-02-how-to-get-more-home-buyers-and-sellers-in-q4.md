Experts predict a busy fourth quarter for real estate, with 40% of business potentially happening then. To capitalize on this, you should be reaching out to our database regularly and having new conversations. But what exactly should we say to get new business? Here are two key talking points relating to the current market that can help you find new deals.

First, rates. **Interest rates have dropped recently but many may not realize how these rate reductions mean in terms of affordability and buying power.** For example, in the last three months, most buyers gained $30,000 more in purchasing power. Reconnect with past clients who wanted to purchase but couldn’t because of affordability concerns. Their monthly payment might be significantly lower. You can also connect them with a lender to see if they’re better qualified now.

Second, equity. The average home price in the Richmond metropolitan area is up by $100,000 in the last three years, resulting in **significant equity gains for homeowners.** Across the country, 16.9% of homeowners own their homes outright or have at least 50% equity. Contact every homeowner you know and share this information. Offer a no-obligation equity assessment to help clients realize how much money is tied up in their homes.

By having new conversations with your database and focusing on these two factors, you can position yourself as a proactive real estate expert. This will help you secure business this fourth quarter and into 2025.
