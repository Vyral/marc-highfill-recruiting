As real estate agents, it is important to understand that our success is determined by our actions. This includes comprehending the sales cycles in the market, which normally have a lag of 3 to 6 months between your actions and results.

However, the last three years in the real estate market have been a frenzy due to low interest rates, low inventory levels, and a surge of buyers. As a result, many agents could close deals within 30 to 45 days of first contact with clients. This quick closing rate is not the norm and is due to the exceptional market conditions that are unlikely to return.

If you got your license within the last 2 or 3 years, you probably closed lots of deals quickly without having to do a lot of work to get clients. That’s great, but **now that the real estate market is returning to normal, homes are taking longer to sell**, and buyers face difficulties getting qualified. This means that agents must work harder to get clients and close deals.&nbsp;

As we start this new year, the sales cycle will be more normal. This means the results you’re getting now have already been determined by your activities during the 3rd and 4th quarters of last year. If you don't have proper guidance, you may be taking actions that will not bring results.
