Agents often get caught up in their daily tasks, such as showings, closings, inspections, and meetings, leaving little time for essential business development. To maintain a consistent flow of clients and avoid commission fluctuations, here are five crucial actions to prioritize:

**1\. Optimize your Google My Business Page.** Google is the world's top search engine, so make it easy for potential clients to find you. Setting up your Google My Business page is a quick and free way to boost your online presence and attract more leads to your website.

**2\. Organize your database.** Create a systematic approach to manage your client and potential client information. This organization enables timely follow-ups and keeps you at the forefront of their minds. Categorize your database by client type, such as buyers, sellers, investors, or referral partners, to tailor your communication to their specific needs.

**3\. Produce video content.** Video is the future of the real estate industry. Creating engaging, informative videos helps you connect with your audience on a personal level and establishes trust more rapidly. Trust leads to clients working with you and referring others to your services.

**4\. Geographic or demographic farming.** Develop a presence in a specific neighborhood you're familiar with or among a particular demographic group. Position yourself as the local real estate expert for that area or group. Dedicate time each week to activities that strengthen your connection with this target market and set the stage for future business.

**5\. Check in with past clients.** Don't overlook the value of staying in touch with past clients who already know and trust you. These individuals can serve as excellent referral sources, and you want to be their first choice when they decide to move again. Even if it's been some time since your last interaction, reaching out with valuable information as a trusted resource will be appreciated.
