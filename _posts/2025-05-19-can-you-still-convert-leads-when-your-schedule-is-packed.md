Spring 2025 is in full swing, and if you’re like most agents right now, I bet you’re absolutely slammed. Between showings, prepping listings, keeping clients updated, and everything else this season throws at you, it can feel nearly impossible to stay on top of your leads. But here’s the thing: *consistent follow-up is what keeps your pipeline alive.*

So, how do you make time for follow-up when your schedule’s already maxed out? Here are three time-saving tips that will help you stay on top of your follow-up game:

**1\. Perfection is the enemy of progress.** One of the biggest traps agents fall into is waiting for the “perfect” moment to follow up. You know what I mean—you want quiet, a solid 30-minute block, all your notes in front of you. *Spoiler alert: that perfect window rarely shows up.*

Instead, focus on what you can do with the time you have. A quick 90-second check-in is far better than nothing. Even something as simple as: *“Hey, just checking in—how’s your home search going?”* can restart the conversation and show you’re engaged. The goal isn’t perfection—it’s consistency.

**2\. Nail your opener and script.** When you’re this busy, every second matters. That’s why a solid opener and a go-to script are game-changers. Try something like: *“Hey \[First Name\], homes in your area are moving fast. I thought of you and wanted to make sure you had the latest info.”* This gives immediate context, adds value, and shows purpose, without wasting time. Practice your opener until it feels natural because the more confident you sound, the smoother your conversations will go.

**3\. Keep conversations short and sweet.** This is not the time for deep life updates or overexplaining your CRM setup. You’re busy and they’re busy, so get to the point. Before you call or message, know exactly why you’re reaching out. Just remember to be clear on your goal—whether it’s scheduling an appointment, sharing an update, or checking on their timeline.

Even during the busiest times of year, follow-up is something you can master—you just need the right mindset and systems. So remember, don’t wait for perfect. Just show up, have your script ready, make it your own, and keep things brief and clear.

If you want help refining your script, practicing your opener, or just need accountability, I’m here. Feel free to shoot me a call, text, or email. Let’s make sure your pipeline doesn’t dry up just because your calendar is full.
