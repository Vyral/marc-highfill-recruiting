In today's fast-paced market, bringing in new leads is essential for business growth. Here are four innovative lead-generation strategies to elevate your business in 2024:

**1\. Utilize QR codes to attract clients.** QR codes have become a staple in our digital world. They offer a quick and easy way for potential clients to access information. Incorporate these codes into your listing fliers, directing people to a website for more details and photos. This not only captures their attention but also their contact information. Extend this strategy by linking QR codes to videos or blog posts with useful tips, such as advice for first-time homebuyers or home selling strategies.

**2\. Create searchable YouTube videos.** Many people overlook the fact that YouTube is the world's second-largest search engine. By creating content that shows up in search results, particularly about local areas or neighborhoods, you position yourself as a local expert. This increases the likelihood of potential clients contacting you when they're considering a move.

**3\. Reach out to Airbnb owners.** With Airbnb's reported revenue decline, many property owners might be rethinking their investments. Their contact information is readily available on listings, making it easy to reach out and offer services like home value analysis or equity reviews. Even if they're content with their current investment, they might be interested in exploring new opportunities.

**4\. Buy lunch, not leads.** Investing in existing relationships can be more fruitful than purchasing internet leads. Set up lunches with lenders, partners, attorneys, insurance agents, and financial advisors to discuss collaboration opportunities. Regularly engaging with your network in this way can significantly impact your business growth.
