Change is constant, but especially so in the real estate industry. Recently, agents have expressed different opinions and concerns about the proposed changes with commissions from the NAR lawsuit. Amidst these upcoming developments, showing value to your clients is more important than ever.

Demonstrate value to your clients by initiating consultations or presentations highlighting your unique strengths. Client calls are the best way to showcase what sets you apart from your competitors and the unique offerings you bring to the table. Use this time to connect with your clients on a deeper level.

**Effectively communicating your process and how working with you to reach their goals makes the client more confident in your ability** to navigate the market, making them want to hire you.
