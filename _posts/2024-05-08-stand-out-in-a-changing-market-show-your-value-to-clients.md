Change is constant, but especially in the real estate industry. Recently, I've had coaching sessions with agent who have expressed concerns about the proposed changes from the NAR lawsuit. Amidst these upcoming developments, showing value to your clients is more important than ever.

Demonstrate value to your clients by initiating consultations or presentations highlighting your unique strengths. An initial face to face or Zoom meeting with clients is the best way to showcase what sets you apart from your competitors, and allows you to highlight the unique offerings you bring to the table. Use this time to connect with your clients on a deeper level to understand their motivation and use your skills to help achieve their real estate goals.

**Effectively communicating your value and showing how working with you to reach their goals makes the client more confident in your ability** to navigate the market, making them want to hire you.
