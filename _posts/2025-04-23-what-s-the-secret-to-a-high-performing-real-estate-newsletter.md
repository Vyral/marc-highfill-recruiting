Let’s be honest. Most real estate emails sound the same. You’ve seen them before: “Thinking of buying or selling? Call me!” That kind of message doesn’t help anyone. It feels pushy, and most people hit delete. I used to send emails like that too, until I realized something important. If I want to stay top of mind, I need to be helpful—not salesy.

Right now, the 2025 real estate market is confusing. Interest rates are starting to settle, but affordability is still a big issue. Inventory is low in many areas. New homes are being built, but not fast enough. On top of that, recent lawsuits have people asking questions about how agents get paid. Many buyers and sellers feel stuck. They don’t know what to do next. That’s where I come in.

I started sending a simple monthly email newsletter. It helps my clients and keeps me connected with them. The best part? I’m not constantly asking for business. Instead, I provide real value. I always include three key things in each email, and they work. Here’s what you need to know:

**1\. Market updates & real estate news.** First, I include a real estate market update. Not just numbers, but actual insight. I explain what’s happening with home prices, interest rates, and local trends. More importantly, I help people understand what it means. Should buyers wait? Should sellers act now? I give them clear, honest guidance.

**2\. Personal & community updates.** Next, I share something personal or community-related. A recent closing with a happy family, a local event I attended, or a behind-the-scenes look at my life as an agent. I also highlight small businesses in the area. This makes the email feel more real and shows I’m not just an agent, but someone who cares about the people and places around me.

**3\. Valuable and timely content.** Finally, I include helpful seasonal tips. This month, it’s all about spring home maintenance, cleaning checklists, and easy landscaping ideas. These tips may have nothing to do with buying or selling a home, but they’re useful and that’s what matters.

This simple approach has changed how I stay in touch. My emails get opened, people reply, and when someone is ready to make a move, they remember me. That’s the power of staying consistent and being helpful.

If you’d like to get my next market update, let me know. I’d be happy to add you to the list. When the time comes to buy or sell, you’ll already know who to call.
