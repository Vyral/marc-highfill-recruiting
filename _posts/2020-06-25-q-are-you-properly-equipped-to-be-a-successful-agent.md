*Here are a few tools that every agent should be able to utilize.*

I often speak with agents who have just one or two tools in their toolbox. What I mean is that they only have one or two ways of bringing in business. Having a couple will only get you so far. **You need a full business toolbox to become an expert real estate agent.**

Some examples of these tools include:

**1\. An accountability system.** You should have a program in place to make sure you’re doing what you say you will and when you say you will do it. With my coaching clients, we set up scorecards to measure their productivity on a daily, monthly, and weekly basis.

**2\. Multiple lead generation systems.** These include internet leads, neighborhood farming, social media posts, client referrals, repeat clients, and more. It’s important to always prospect, but also attract business to you without chasing after it.

**3\. A useful CRM and autoresponders.** What’s the best CRM? My answer is that a CRM you can understand and use is the best one. A CRM and autoresponders make lead generation easy and can help you gain leads passively, especially over time.&nbsp;

**4\. Ongoing regular coaching.** The most important tool you can have as an agent is a guide who can help push you into growth every day. As Realtors, I feel like we tend to be pulled in many directions at once and become reactive instead of proactive. I’ve come to learn that the proactive approach is best. You need a coach to help you get better every day and give you a slight edge over your competition.

These are just a few examples of the tools you can and should be adding to your toolbox as a real estate agent. If you’d like to learn more, I invite you to join me for my next free agent help session via Zoom, which I host every Wednesday from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. [**You can register here.**](https://richmondrealestatejobs.com/)
