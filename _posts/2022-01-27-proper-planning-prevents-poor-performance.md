All highly successful people plan their days in advance. The more precise your planning is, the more successful you’ll be. **Time blocking is a great way to start;** all you have to do is create your schedule by blocking out times for certain activities.&nbsp;

For example, if you block two hours in the morning for prospecting, you need to plan exactly what lead sources you’ll call during that time. You could, say, block out the hour between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. for calling internet leads like Zillow or Realtor.com. Then you could block the hour between 11 a.m. and noon to call past clients or your sphere of influence. With your past clients and sphere, make sure you write down the exact names of the people you’re calling so that you’re keeping a continuous rotation of connection with your clients.&nbsp;

**Use the same formula for every block of time in your calendar**, including time for marketing activities, showings, listing/buyer appointments, etc. Also, make sure to include a block for follow-up time. For many agents, the issue isn’t a lack of leads but rather a lack of follow-up. We all speak to people who tell you to call them next week or that they’ll call you in a couple of days. Take a minute to go forward to that time in your calendar and create a “heard from” category for your follow-up. Then, write that person’s name down in your “follow-up” block so that you know to touch base when you said you would. That helps to ensure that leads don’t fall through the cracks.

No matter what kind of calendar you use—whether it’s a high-tech internet calendar or an old school calendar book (like mine)—writing down precisely what you are going to do and when you are going to do it will increase your success.

**Taking time every evening to plan your next day in advance will help you stay on track with your goals, and it will alleviate stress.** You won’t have to worry about what you’re going to do to get business every morning because you’ve already put a plan in place the night before.
