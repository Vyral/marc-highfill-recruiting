Have you experienced having a second chance with a career you once loved? That’s the story of Kathy Melvin, one of our Realtors at EXIT First Realty. I was curious about Kathy’s journey back to real estate after a successful career in medical device sales.

Kathy shared that she’s always had a passion for real estate, and even though the industry has changed a lot since she was last involved, her love for helping clients find their dream homes has never left. The biggest challenge, she admitted, was regaining the discipline and patience required in real estate. However, her previous sales experience taught her to have a work ethic and an understanding needed to build and maintain lasting relationships with clients.<br>When I asked Kathy why she chose to join our team, she mentioned **our training program and supportive team environment.** She felt that even with her extensive sales background, she still needed guidance regarding the complexities of the real estate market. Knowing that there’s always someone who could help contributed to her growth as an agent.

She also stressed the importance of having a solid foundation in real estate and taking things one step at a time.
