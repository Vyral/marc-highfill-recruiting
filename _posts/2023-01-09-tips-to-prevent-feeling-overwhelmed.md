The new year brings new resolutions for your business. However, some agents can get overwhelmed with setting goals, what to track, and what activities to focus on. Some agents even get stuck not knowing where to start. Let me simplify things for you.

Instead of focusing on what you want to do for the whole year, **just focus on the next 12 weeks**. How many transactions do you want to do? Where do you want those deals to come from? What will you do every day to make that happen? Breaking your goal into a smaller, 12-week plan makes things more manageable, and it pushes you to get things done more quickly. A 12-week plan means you don't have time to put things off.

**If you want to succeed by the end of 90 days, start by figuring out where your business came from** last year and focus your activities on how to get more of that business over the next three months. Then create a scorecard for yourself. Your scorecards should consist of daily and weekly activities that help you to achieve your 12-week goal.

Track your numbers every day, and then every week. Find someone to help hold you accountable. For example, you should be spending time every day reaching out to new people, following up with prospects in your pipeline, and keeping in touch with your sphere of influence and past clients. Create a defined time each day for those activities, and then stick to it. If it's on your calendar, it must be done. If it's not on your calendar, it doesn't really even exist. This is the rule to hold yourself accountable and to achieve the results you want.
