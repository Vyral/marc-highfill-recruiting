The real estate market is shifting, and whether you’re new to the industry or an experienced agent, you need to know how to adapt. Today I want to share some tips that have helped my team remain successful throughout the years.

**One of the best ways to continuously grow your business is to get back to basics.** Keep up with your sphere of influence and past clients. You might have to do more prospecting than you once did. You’ll have to talk to more people to find opportunities to grow your business.

The most important thing you can do to keep up with this market is to **put yourself in an environment that encourages growth.** Be as knowledgeable and accountable as possible so that you’re an expert for your clients. Surround yourself with other industry professionals who discuss real-world situations and offer you advice.

I’ve been in this industry for over 20 years. I’ve seen recessions, booms, and everything between, and through each of those changes, my team has managed to become more and more profitable each time.&nbsp;
