Are you considering making a career shift? Recently, I’ve had the pleasure of interviewing Dudley Stainback, one of our Realtors here at EXIT First Realty. He made a successful transition from the electrical industry to real estate. With 40 years of experience in sales and sales management at Graybar Electric Company, he was able to easily build rapport with clients.

He shared that one of the biggest reasons why he chose to enter the real estate industry was his son, who also worked with us, but it was the positive energy and the growth he experienced with the team that made him stay. Dudley is looking forward to growing more and is excited about the opportunities moving forward with the team.
