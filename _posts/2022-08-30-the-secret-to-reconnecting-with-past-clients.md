Have you neglected a past client before? It happens to everyone, but it’s important to reconnect with them to grow your business. After all, repeats and referrals are the keys to taking your business to the next level.

Let me paint a picture: You spend so much time and energy nurturing leads. You finally get a client, and you work closely with them for weeks, maybe months. After all the stress, you get them to closing. You’ve learned so much about them and their family, but after the transaction, it all ends. They move, and you turn your attention to your next client. Before you know it, years have passed, and you haven’t kept up with them.

**Is that relationship dead?** No. You might feel nervous or guilty about reconnecting, but here’s a secret: It’s never too late to reconnect. Too many agents let this happen. Even top-producing agents don’t always have the best system to stay in touch with their clients.

Here’s a simple way to reconnect with your past clients no matter how long it’s been: **Blame it on your database.** Reach out and say, “Hi, I’m the agent who sold your home. I’m sorry for not staying in touch—I’ve had a bad database, but now I’m upgrading. I just wanted to reach out and see how you’re doing.”

This lets you remind the client that you were their agent, ask for their forgiveness, and put the blame on a bad system. Most people can relate, and this is a reasonable excuse for losing touch.

However, **the important thing is that you try to bring back the relationship**. The goal in the initial conversation is to reconnect, not to sell. Keep yourself top of mind and regularly stay in touch. If you do this, you’ll get a lot more repeat and referral business.
