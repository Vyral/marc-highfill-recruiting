The key to being more successful is time blocking and time management. How do you manage your time efficiently and utilize time blocking?

First, you must **use a calendar system.** Whether it’s a calendar book or Google Calendar, you need a calendar you’ll use every day.&nbsp;

Once you have a calendar, it’s time to schedule your “rocks.” These are the most important things that must be done every day, like prospecting, showing appointments, inspections, etc. These things are non-negotiable, don’t interfere with them.&nbsp;

You should prospect for at least two hours, and your prospecting goal is to schedule appointments. If you’re prospecting for one hour, prospect hard and fast for 50 minutes and then take a 10-minute break. If you need to check your phone, get up and walk around, or do anything else you need to do to keep your energy up, do it during this break. The next hour, do the exact same thing.&nbsp;

When scheduling your prospecting time, you must also schedule who you’ll call specifically. This is something a lot of agents forget to do. You should know who you’ll call ahead of time so that when you’re in your prospecting zone, you're focused and getting calls done left and right. You’d be amazed how many calls you can make by doing this.&nbsp;

Also, **don’t turn your calendar into a to-do list,** where you have appointments and other things scheduled back to back all day long. You need to schedule breaks in between.&nbsp;

What does all of this mean? Some experienced agents don’t use disciplined calendars day to day, week to week. They end up being reactive instead of proactive and don’t get the most important prospecting activities done.&nbsp;

The secret to keeping a disciplined calendar is holding yourself accountable to all scheduled activities. On my team, our system involves a daily and weekly scorecard. If we maintain our daily successes throughout each week, we get a good score. That’s a direct indication of future business and success.
