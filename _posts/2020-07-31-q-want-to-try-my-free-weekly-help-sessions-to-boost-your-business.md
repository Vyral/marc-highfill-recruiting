*How can your business benefit from free weekly coaching? Find out today.*

Do you want to improve your business and make your entire life easier? Could you benefit from an accounting plan as well as specific strategies to help you grow your business to the next level?

If you said yes to any of those questions, **I invite you to join me for a free agent help session held every Wednesday.**

You see, if you’re not constantly trying to improve yourself—even by just 1%—then how can you achieve your goals?

I speak with agents every day who have had big ideas and want to reach the next level of their careers but who lacked a solid plan or a means of holding themselves accountable.

I’ve been holding these weekly help sessions for over two months now, and **several agents who have attended have been able to expand their businesses more than ever.**

For example, I have one agent who isn’t even with Exit First Realty who has attended every session. She’s been in the business for over 18 years and was doing an average of four or five deals a year. She even paid another coach $2,000 for a program that just wasn’t successful for her. After a few weeks of attending my weekly help sessions, she implemented specific strategies with action steps into her business that have already increased her closed deals and profits this year.

Many companies promise a 100% commission, but they often lack the support and coaching needed to really leverage your success. What I’m offering is free advice that is specifically tailored to your business to allow you to move to the next level.

I’ll also provide you with more accountability, support, and opportunities so that **you can have the freedom to work*****on *****your business**—not necessarily *in* your business.

This is not an effort to recruit you to my company, although there are ways to grow your business by building passive income with Exit First Realty, if you’re interested. **This is just me helping you get better so that we can provide a greater level of service to our clients.**

If you’re interested in joining me for a free weekly help secession, register on our website at [www.RichmondRealEstateJobs.com](http://www.richmondrealestatejobs.com). For any questions you have, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

And remember: It’s not the market—it’s the marketing that makes the difference.
