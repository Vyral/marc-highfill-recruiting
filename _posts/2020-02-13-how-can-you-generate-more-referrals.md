<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Repeat clients and referrals are one of the most reliable sources of business. Here’s what you need to do to make this a pillar of yours.</em></p>

If you want to generate more referral business from your past clients and sphere of influence, here are the things you must be doing:

**1\. You need to have a CRM and database.** Which CRM is the best to use? The one that you use. It’s best to have one centrally located database, too. I’ve talked to some agents who’ve used Follow Up Boss, Boomtown, and Top Producer who have all had success. It’s important to keep that database in one place, add to it every day, and make sure everyone you know is in there.&nbsp;

**2\. Reach out to your database at least once a month.** Each of our agents has a system set up to do this. It can be a text, email, phone call, or even a postcard. However, don’t use the same contact method twice in a row. Make sure these touches are scheduled in your calendar, too. It sounds easy, but I run across experienced agents every day who aren’t doing this.

**3\. Provide value.** I hear from agents all the time who hesitate to reach out to their database because they don’t know what to bring in terms of value. It can be as easy as providing the latest market numbers or listings for buyers, or quarterly stats and a home value estimate for sellers. By staying in touch and letting them know you bring value, you'll be considered a market expert. 

For past clients who aren’t buying or selling right now, you want to be a resource by providing helpful, educational content. You can’t be what I call a “secret agent.” I see too many agents forget their past clients after helping them through a transaction. By keeping in touch with these people, you can earn their business over and over.

With these three tips, I guarantee that you’ll get more referral business. Just stay in touch regularly and provide value. If you’d like more specific tips, just give me a call or send an email. I would love to help you take your business to the next level.
