Is your 2025 heading toward a quiet finish? For many agents, the fourth quarter feels like a wind-down, but for the top performers, it’s the most important launchpad for the new year. The difference lies in a strategic shift from chasing any lead to intentionally pursuing seller leads. I’ve seen agents completely transform their trajectory in the next few months by focusing on the right sources. If you feel like your business needs a jumpstart, this is for you.

Here are my top five, zero-cost lead sources:

**1\. Your database is a goldmine waiting for you.** The easiest leads are the people who already know you. Your sphere of influence is not just for your first year; it’s your most valuable asset. The challenge is staying top of mind without being salesy. A simple, helpful approach works best. Try a message like, “I’m helping a few families make a move before the new year and am checking to see if you know anyone who might be considering the same.” This frames you as a resource, not a salesperson.

**2\. Unlock motivated sellers in tired landlords.** Beyond your network, specific groups are highly motivated to sell. Absentee landlords can be feeling the pressure of rising costs and tenant management. By using tools in your MLS, you can identify these owners and reach out with a solution-oriented message. You’re solving a problem they are likely already thinking about.

**3\. Give expired listings a second chance**. A listing that expired 12 to 18 months ago doesn’t mean the seller’s desire to move disappeared. Their previous agent may have priced it poorly or lacked the right marketing. The market conditions have likely changed in your favor. A respectful outreach can reopen a conversation that everyone else has forgotten.

**4\. Build partnerships that bring you leads.** A highly underutilized strategy is building relationships with new construction sales reps. Every person buying a new home needs to sell their current one. By positioning yourself as a reliable resource for these buyers, you consistently get warm, motivated seller leads.

**5\. Become the local expert everyone trusts.** Finally, your local community groups are full of potential. When someone posts about selling, don’t just say “Call me.” Offer value first. Share a market insight or a helpful tip. When people see you as a knowledgeable expert, they will privately message you when they’re ready.

If your Q4 plan doesn’t include these five strategies, you’re leaving momentum on the table. The fourth quarter is not a time to slow down; it’s your chance to build a foundation for next year while closing this one strong.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Just call, text, or email me. I’d be happy to go on a quick strategy call to discuss your Q4 goals.

Let’s make this quarter your best one yet.
