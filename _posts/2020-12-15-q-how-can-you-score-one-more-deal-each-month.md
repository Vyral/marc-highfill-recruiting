*Here’s how our coaching systems can bring you one extra deal per month.&nbsp;*

Do you want to close more deals? If so, could you benefit from advanced and ongoing coaching to help grow your business?&nbsp;

The coaching systems we offer at Exit First Realty are free and proven to produce one to two extra deals a month, or a 30% to 50% yearly increase for first- and second-year agents. This growth continues over time, as our systems are designed around consistent coaching regardless of your experience. Our philosophy boils down to this: 1% better every day. We believe that if you’re not constantly growing and learning new things, you’ll never increase your business and meet your goals.&nbsp;

How can you benefit from this? **We help you unlock more tools for your toolbox by offering real-time mentoring from agents and brokers.** We work together as a family to learn from each other’s experiences. Our coaches are also active in the field as high-producing real estate agents. These aren’t brokers who *used to* sell back in the old days; they’re in the streets every day making deals happen.

We use these real world experiences to develop strategies that allow the whole team to benefit from their street smarts. We also allow you to create a custom coaching strategy that’s specific to your goals and personality type. It’s not the kind of one-size-fits-all approach that many other brokerages offer. We leverage the combined knowledge of the team to propel you forward in your business.&nbsp;

Oh, and did I mention this coaching is *free*? **There are no desk fees, no programs you’re required to sign up for, and no out-of-pocket expenses.** Additionally, you have the option of receiving this coaching in person or via Zoom. We incur the cost of this training and pass on its value to our agents. Why? Exit First Realty believes in building strong offices, which starts with building strong and successful agents.&nbsp;

Now’s the time to plan for your business in 2021. You need to create specific activities and disciplines in order to achieve next year's goals, and Exit First Realty is here to help. I’m a firm believer that if you show me somebody’s disciplines, I’ll be able to predict their future results.&nbsp;

If you’d like to schedule a consultation with one of our coaches to develop a personalized coaching program, contact us today for a free business strategy session. We’ll assess your current production, evaluate your goals, and create a plan to help you close more deals.&nbsp;

As always, if there's anything else I can assist you with, feel free to call or email me anytime. I’d love to speak with you. Remember: It’s not the market, it’s the marketing that makes the difference.&nbsp;
