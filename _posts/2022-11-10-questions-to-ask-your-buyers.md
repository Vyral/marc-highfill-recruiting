During recent coaching sessions, several agents have asked me, “What scripts should I be using in this market?” My answer is always: What questions should you be asking buyers in this market? Overcoming objections is just about regaining control of the conversation. The best way to do that is by asking questions. Therefore, I'm here to bring you a three-question strategy you should be using to help drive conversations about the current market without coming off as very salesy.

**If you're talking to someone anxious, ask them, “What have you heard about the real estate market right now?”** You'll probably hear all kinds of fear-based responses like “The market's terrible, now's a bad time to buy, and there's a crash coming.” Instead of going into defensive mode and fire-hosing them with information right away, ask: “Would you mind sharing your sources?” Don't ask in an aggressive way; just be curious. They'll probably respond with gossip from a friend or family member, or they read a headline but didn't get the full context.

The third question is: “Has anyone taken the time to show you the real data on our local market?” The whole dynamic changes when you phrase it as a question. You're not being pushy, and you're not demanding that they listen to a sales pitch about why now's the best time to buy. You're offering to show them accurate data to help them make an informed decision.

The fact is, **there are more opportunities for buyers now than there were six months ago**. It's our responsibility as agents not to play into the fear and, instead, be a resource to help buyers create deals in this normalizing market. If you'd like more information about how to implement this three-question strategy and other ways to overcome buyer objections in this market, contact us today. Our coaches will help you create a dialog to gain a buyer's trust and close more deals. Remember, it's not the market… it’s the marketing that makes the difference.
