For many years, I have seen agents struggle with their real estate business. Nowadays, it seems like the struggle has multiplied and become a hundred times more challenging: listings are harder to come by, it’s harder to find qualified buyers, and many agents are thinking about giving up because of the fast-paced industry shifts and unpredictability.

Don’t give up just yet! I’m here to tell you that I have proven strategies to help you find business right now and set up a pipeline for future business. So, if you are feeling stuck and want some guidance, you can schedule a 30-minute coaching session with me.

To give you an idea of who I am and why I’m qualified and competent to coach you, I’ll let you know that I have been in the real estate business for over 20 years. **I’ve built teams of high-producing agents who have remained successful through changing market conditions**. This experience has taught me how to adapt and overcome, no matter how the market shifts.

Because of my experience, I have come up with a solid and effective strategy that can work for you. During our coaching session, I’ll listen to your goals and discover your strengths as an agent. From there, **we can devise an exact action plan you can immediately utilize.** I promise no recruitment tactics, just one real estate professional to the other who wants to give honest advice to help you grow personally and in your career.

You might be thinking, What's the catch? Why would I do this?

Believe it or not, I have seen many agents who don’t get the support they need to be successful. After getting their license, no one takes the time to mentor them to build a thriving career. That is why I am offering coaching sessions to raise the standard in the industry and better serve our clients.

If you’re interested, reach out to me directly by phone or email. You can also directly [set a schedule on my calendar](https://calendly.com/marcaustinhighfillcoach). I look forward to helping you become the real estate agent you aspire to be. And always remember that in real estate, it’s not the market… it’s the marketing that makes a difference.
