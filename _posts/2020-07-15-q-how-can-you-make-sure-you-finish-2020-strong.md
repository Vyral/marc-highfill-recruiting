*If you want to crush your goals for the second half of2020, here are the four rules you must remember.&nbsp;*

**1\. Master your morning routine.** Set a schedule and stick to it. Every morning you should have the same routine to help get your mindset right. You could exercise, listen to a podcast, read an inspirational book, meditate, etc. Even making your bed is a small win that can set the tone for the rest of the day. Do whatever you need to do to get your attitude and mindset correct.&nbsp;

**2\. Check the MLS stats and hot sheets daily.** You need to understand specifically what’s happening in the market and how you can provide that information to your clients. These stats will help you provide specific information when someone asks what’s happening in the market. This information will also help you assist your clients in writing offers and finding homes.

**3\. Schedule appointment setting times daily.** In our office, we’re not calling it “prospecting time” anymore—we’re calling it “appointment setting time.” You need to change your mindset and substitute prospecting with appointment setting. This reinforced the mentality of setting appointments when you pick up the phone. Your sole job is to connect with prospects and get appointments. Instead of saying you’re just prospecting for two hours a day, have a goal of setting a certain number of appointments. See how much more successful you can be when changing your mindset.&nbsp;

**4\. Measure your activities and success.** You’ve probably heard me talk before about accountability and knowing your numbers. If you don’t know your numbers, how can you measure success? I can’t stress enough how important it is to track your activities and progress. Sales is a numbers game, and let’s face it: We’re in a sales field. Always measure specific activities to see how they correlate with your regular sales. Know the numbers of calls, showings, and appointments that lead to contracts and sales. This actually helps you pay attention when your sales aren’t where they should be. Track your activities, find a coach to hold you accountable to those activities, and your success will grow.&nbsp;
