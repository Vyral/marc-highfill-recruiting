There are times that even the best training and scripting cannot prepare you for every situation you encounter in this business. That is why daily coaching sessions are important. It is an opportunity for us to share first-hand experiences in order to find innovative solutions and learn from each other. Below are some examples of how our daily sessions have helped us become better agents.

Recently, we talked about **how to negotiate an off-market deal involving multiple transactions.** One of our agents used a smart strategy to help find a home for a buyer, who had to sell a house in a different state. Our agent found a potential seller who is interested in one of our listings on one condition: they should find a buyer for their own home first. This required working with several parties at the same time. Through open communication, we were able to find a solution that both parties can be happy with.

Another common theme that comes up during our daily coaching is the **importance of understanding and communicating with people with different personality styles.** To be effective with your clients, you should understand your own personality style and that of your client. If you are working with a highly analytical buyer, you should give your client as much information as you can and not pressure them to make a sale. On the other hand, if you’re dealing with a driver client, you need to let them feel in control, or they will shut you out. Understanding how to communicate with your client will help you get more clients and close more deals.

Lastly, we also talked about **the importance of using a timeline to drive motivation.** Motivation drives people to make decisions. If you don’t tap into that, you’ll never be able to get clients off the fence. For instance, one of our agents had a buyer who thought that they had plenty of time to make an offer, so they kept on pushing back on making offers since their lease wasn't up until the end of August. When we worked that timeline backward and took into account a 30- to 45-day closing, there were only a few days of overlap between closing on their new home and lease expiration. Our agent explained this to the clients, and finally they understood that they needed to be more decisive.

These are just a few examples of how our daily coaching sessions help us improve. Each agent, regardless of experience, can learn something new or review their sales strategies. This collaborative approach makes everyone better equipped to serve their clients and close more deals.
