*Megan Murphy went from newbie agent to an integral part of our management team. *

Today we’re sitting down with Megan Murphy, agent extraordinaire, trainer and coach with Exit First Realty to discuss her life before real estate, what drew her into the business, and why she chose to pursue her career through us. As is the case for so many new agents, Megan relished the opportunity to set her own schedule and make exponential income but had to confront the stress of moving from a steady, dependable paycheck to a lifestyle of commission-only pay. Ultimately, she credits Exit First’s coaching and training resources with her success in the business.&nbsp;

In her own words: “I think, realistically, when you focus on what your ‘why’ is, Exit \[First Realty\] helps provide you with the resources to really achieve your ‘why.’”
