*Here’s how to set your business up for success in 2021.&nbsp;*

Lately, some of our agents’ business has plateaued in advance of the coming holiday season, either due to changes in the market or uncertainty about the future. This thing is, now is actually the most important time for you to refocus your energy, create a solid business plan, and put an accountability system in place so you can start next year with a bang.&nbsp;

We all know the market is bustling as we make our way through fall, but there is some volatility on the horizon. With the upcoming presidential election and foreseeable market inconsistencies, **it’s more important than ever to provide facts to your clients and establish good daily activities** so you can be the expert to guide them through this uncertainty.&nbsp;

Most clients and potential clients are hearing conflicting information about future real estate market predictions. There is some misinformation out there indicating that home prices may plummet, mortgage rates may increase drastically, and the market may slow down significantly. Some clients were personally affected by the market crash of 2008 (or know someone who was affected) and still harbor a strong memory that it may happen again.&nbsp;

As real estate professionals, **it’s our job to be knowledgeable brokers and provide hard facts about the market.** You should use that data to ease your clients’ fears and continue to drive your business forward. For example, roughly 42% of all U.S. homeowners own their homes free and clear, and about 90% of all mortgages have at least 10% to 15% equity. This means most homeowners can walk away with profit even if they were forced to sell. Current market conditions aren’t the same as they were in 2008, so another market crash is unlikely.

This is the kind of data I share with my agents weekly so they can help guide their clients through any uncertainty. It’s also imperative for agents to create habits and implement systems now to ensure future success regardless of market changes. This means you need to create a business plan that can account for any uncertainty and get a coach who can hold you accountable to your plan. You also need to keep up your daily activities (e.g., prospecting, scorecard tracking, and rigorous calendar blocking) to grow your business in 2021.&nbsp;

As a real estate coach, **I provide tools you can use to continue your success as we head into the new year.** I will work with you to create a plan and help hold you accountable for your actions. I guarantee I can help you close more deals next year even if the market changes significantly. By the way, I provide all of this for free\!

You can join me every Wednesday for my weekly agent help session from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. I host these sessions via Zoom and answer any questions about where the market is headed and how you can set up systems to stay ahead of the curb. If you’re interested in joining these sessions or would like to schedule a personal strategy call to prepare your business for 2021, visit my website richmondrealestatejobs.com. You can also call my office or shoot me an email.&nbsp;

As always, if you have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. I’d love to speak with you. Remember: it’s not the market, it’s the marketing that makes the difference.
