*By following the EXIT Formula, you can make passive, residual income.*

What makes EXIT First Realty different from other brokerages? It’s not just the coaching, technology, and accountability we offer. It’s also the EXIT Formula, a unique system that allows you to make more than a 100% commission. If you’re tired of the commission roller coaster most agents face and would like a system of passive, residual income instead of relying solely on your own production, this formula is for you. We’ve used it to revolutionize the real estate industry for agents.&nbsp;

The income produced from this formula will enhance your life, dreams, retirement, and—quite frankly—your legacy. It’s not dependent on the profitability of the company or some independent stock evaluation. This income comes right off the top. It’s easy to always know exactly how much you’ll make.&nbsp;

**To learn how the EXIT Formula works, watch the video above in its entirety. I’ve also provided timestamps so you can skip to various points at your leisure:**
