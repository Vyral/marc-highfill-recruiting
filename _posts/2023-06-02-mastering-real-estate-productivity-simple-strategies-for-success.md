As real estate agents, it's very easy for us to feel overwhelmed in this business. We can often feel like we have a million things to do but don't know where to start. Sometimes this leads to agents spending time on activities that aren't productive. Therefore, what can we do about all of this? &nbsp;

One way is to use a calendar. This gives you a place to write down everything you need to do and when you need to do it. You can use a physical book or digital calendars like Google or Outlook. Also, **hold yourself accountable for maintaining your schedule.**

Another trick for being more productive is to time block the activities in your calendar. This means that you do certain activities every day at certain times during those time blocks. Don't let anything distract you from your scheduled activities. Include time blocks for following up with previous leads and past clients, checking in with your center of influence, and prospecting for new business. Also, be specific when you write things down.&nbsp;

Lastly, **each night take time to plan for the next day.** Then block out your scheduled appointments, prospecting time, time to study the market, and more. Then include a list of people you need to follow up with or marketing activities that you need to complete. These strategies will help you feel more organized in your business and focus on activities that truly help you grow.&nbsp;
