*Here’s what agent John Chistman had to say about our training and support. *

Today we’re sitting down with John Christman, one of our newer agents here at Exit First Realty, to hear his perspective on the ways in which our brand has been able to jump-start his career in real estate and help him pursue his goals. After running a Chesterfield breakfast and lunch restaurant franchise for eight years, John decided to make the switch into real estate so he could create a stronger financial foundation for his family while continuing to make an impact in the lives of people in our community and enjoy an entrepreneur’s freedom.
