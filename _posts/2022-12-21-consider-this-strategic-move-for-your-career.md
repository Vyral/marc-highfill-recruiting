The market has changed, and for some agents, deals are harder to find right now. The cost of being a full-time real estate agent can be a burden without closings in the pipeline. If this change has made you want to get out of the business, or if you’re thinking of retiring from real estate, hold that thought.&nbsp;

There is a way for you to keep your license active, lower your expenses, and still receive income from people you know who might move in the future: **By joining EXIT First Realty’s Referral Brokerage, you get to keep an active license without worrying about actively selling real estate.**

You can eliminate the annual Realtor dues and don't have to pay monthly MLS fees, but still get to earn referral commissions from your past clients, your sphere of influence, and people you meet who need to move, while someone else does the hard work.
