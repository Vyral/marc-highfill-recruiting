For many agents, prospecting brings a wave of hesitation. Picking up the phone, knocking on doors, or approaching someone at an open house can feel uncomfortable and intrusive. That fear often leads to avoidance—and, with it, missed opportunities. Moving through that discomfort is key if you aim to build steady momentum and attract more listings this spring.

Prospecting doesn't need to feel like a chore. With the right approach, it can feel more like a genuine conversation and less like a sales pitch. Here are three practical tips that can help you show up with confidence, connect more naturally, and build stronger relationships:

**1\. Lead with value, not with a pitch.** People are more open to a conversation when they understand how it benefits them. Start with something helpful and relevant rather than opening with a sales script. For example: "I wanted to give you a quick update. Homes in your neighborhood are selling for 6% more than they were this time last year." This type of opening positions you as a local expert and gives the person a reason to stay on the call. When you lead with value, you build trust, and trust is what gets people talking.

**2\. Sound like yourself, not a script.** Scripts are helpful, but not when they strip away your personality. Building rapport is harder if your tone feels stiff or rehearsed. The key is to practice your script until it sounds like something you'd naturally say. Use your own words, keep your pacing relaxed, and don't be afraid to let your personality come through. A real conversation always goes further than a perfect pitch. And if the nerves kick in before you dial, pause for a breath, reset your energy, and remind yourself that you're reaching out to help, not to push.

**3\. See rejection as part of the process.** Not every call will lead to a win, and that's expected. Most agents hear "no" far more often than "yes," especially with cold outreach. Instead of seeing that as a failure, view each call as a step toward improving your skills and building resilience. Every conversation counts. Track your activity and focus on consistency. The results will follow.

If prospecting has been on the back burner, now's the time to bring it forward. Practice with a peer, run through your script out loud, and commit to just a few calls a day. If you want someone to help you refine your approach, review your message, or simply stay accountable, call or email me. Your next listing may be one conversation away—all you have to do is start.
