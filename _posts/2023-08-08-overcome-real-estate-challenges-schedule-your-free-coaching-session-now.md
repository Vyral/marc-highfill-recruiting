Every day, I coach agents who are struggling in this current, tough real estate market—listings are scarce, finding qualified buyers is challenging, and many real estate professionals are considering giving up. If you’re one of them, I'm here to tell you that I have some proven strategies to help you find new business and set up a pipeline for the future. **If you're feeling lost and unsure of what to do, schedule a 15- to 30-minute coaching session with me.**

I've been in this business for over 20 years and have built a team of high-producing agents. We have remained successful through every changing market during that time. This experience has taught us the ability to adapt and overcome, no matter how the market shifts, so trust me when I say that I have an action plan that can work for you right now. Schedule a coaching session with me, and I will listen to your goals, find out your strengths as an agent, and provide you with a specific action step list to get business right now.

**There will be no recruiting tactics, just an honest conversation to help you grow your business.** Too often, I see agents who don't get the support and coaching they need to be successful. They get their license but then feel like no one takes the time to really mentor them.

I'm offering this coaching session to raise the standard in our industry, so we can all better serve our clients. If you'd like to book a free, no-obligation coaching call, reach out to me directly or [click this link](https://calendly.com/marcaustinhighfill/30min). I look forward to helping you become the real estate agent you want to be, and remember, it's not the market, it's the marketing that makes the difference!
