Today I’m here with one of our great real estate agents, Jeanne Brooksbank, to chat about her journey, why she initially chose Exit First Realty, why she eventually came back to Exit First Realty, and where she sees our company heading. Before working in real estate, Jeanne graduated from college and immediately went into the aviation marketing field. Then she had kids and took a 10-year hiatus from working. That got her thinking about what she could do as a career that would allow her the flexibility to be with her kids. She thought real estate could be a great opportunity, and the rest is history.&nbsp;
