Are you showing home after home, rushing from one tour to the next, and trying to keep up with your buyers at the same time? If this feels familiar, you’ve reached the point where a showing assistant can help you take the next step. But how should you pay them?

While there is no one-size-fits-all strategy, here’s what you can do and some things you should consider.

**1\. Know their role.** Before selecting a pay plan, clarify the role you want them to play. First, clarify whether your showing assistant is licensed or unlicensed. A licensed assistant can show homes on your behalf, while an unlicensed one cannot. They can help with scheduling, planning, or opening doors under your supervision. When you know their role, you avoid risk and protect your business.

**2\. Choose a simple plan.** There are three common ways to pay a showing assistant. You can pay per showing. Most agents pay $25 to $50 per door, depending on the market. This works if you need help occasionally. You can pay hourly. Most pay $20 to $35 per hour. This works if you want steady help. Or you can pay a commission split. Most agents give 10 to 20 percent of the gross commission on buyer deals. This works when you want clear rewards for results.

It’s important to note, however, that standard rates and payment strategies can vary by state due to local regulations and industry practices. Make sure you review your state’s specific rules and seek advice from local Realtors.

**3\. Set clear expectations.** Before they start, write down the rules. Decide who schedules tours. Decide who talks with the client. Decide how you track mileage, payments, and time. When everything is clear, your assistant knows how to win. This prevents stress and keeps the work smooth.

**4\. Watch the return.** A showing assistant should help you earn more or save more time. Track the hours they cover. Track the extra clients you can take because of them. If your income grows, the system is working. If not, adjust the plan.

Hiring a showing assistant can help you grow faster and with less stress. You can serve more clients, keep your buyers happy, and protect your time.
