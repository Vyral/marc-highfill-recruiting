<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes right here in Richmond?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>
<li>Question and answer videos</li>
<li>Highlights of our team training</li>
<li>Our favorite technology tips</li>
</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the coaching we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year over 18,000 homes sold in the greater Richmond market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell almost 300 homes last year and our average agent earns $60,000 - $75,000 a year following our coaching systems.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>
<li>Attract buyers who actually want to buy</li>
<li>Convert more leads to appointments</li>
<li>Win more listing presentations at full commission</li>
<li>Systematize your administrative processes</li>
<li>Earn more referrals and reviews for repeat business</li>
</ol></p>

<p>…I invite you to subscribe to our free newsletter below.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"EXIT’s weekly coaching meetings and training opportunities have allowed me to grow my business more than I would have on my own. Plus, having access to a free CRM has made it easy to keep in touch with my sphere, past clients, and to generate new leads." <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Megan, 3-year agent</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"There is always a seasoned agent on call to bounce ideas off of or to go to if you need help with a situation. Someone is always available to reach out to so you don’t have to be on your own as an agent. I find that this has helped me provide better solutions for my clients, and it has also helped me be a better agent as I can help others as well." <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Lisa, Associate Broker and 15-year agent</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">The availability of in-company training for active agents is unmatched. It helps from the perspective of convenience - being able to pop into the office anytime for coaching to get better, and of support - being able to call a Broker or another agent to get help anytime you need. It has helped me grow a very successful real estate career, even as a part-time agent. <br><span class="testimonial-author">- Matthew, full-time Firefighter and part-time agent for 7 years</span></p>
