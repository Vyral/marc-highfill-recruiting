<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Marc Austin Highfill with EXIT First Realty and we’ve sold over 4,000 homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"EXIT’s weekly coaching meetings and training opportunities have allowed me to grow my business more than I would have on my own. Plus, having access to a free CRM has made it easy to keep in touch with my sphere, past clients, and to generate new leads."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Megan, 3-year agent</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"There is always a seasoned agent on call to bounce ideas off of or to go to if you need help with a situation. Someone is always available to reach out to so you don’t have to be on your own as an agent. I find that this has helped me provide better solutions for my clients, and it has also helped me be a better agent as I can help others as well."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Lisa, Associate Broker and 15-year agent</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"The availability of in-company trainings for active agents is unmatched. It helps from the perspective of convenience - being able to pop into the office anytime for coaching to get better, and of support - being able to call a Broker or another agent to get help anytime you need. It has helped me grow a very successful real estate career, even as a part-time agent."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Matthew, full-time Firefighter and part-time agent for 7 years</span></p>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team or with our brokerage.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Marc Highfill</p>
